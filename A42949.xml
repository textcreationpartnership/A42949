         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the moſt Reverend Father in God,
WILLIAM by Divine Providence,
Lord Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury, his
Grace; Of all England Primate and
Metropolitan, and one of his Sacred
Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy
Council.</head>

               <salute>May it pleaſe your Grace,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is at once both the Duty and Intereſt of
theſe Papers to beſeech your Favour and
Patronage, and to beg leave to carry in their
Front a Name ſo ſacred; as being not only
a Sanctuary from danger, and a Preſervative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the infection and poyſon of Malicious Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
but alſo ſo rich an Ornament, as in it ſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to give them that Reputation and Luſtre
which of themſelves they wanted, and to ſupply all
the Defects and Errors of the unskilful Author.</p>
            <p>An Ambition I ſhould confeſs unpardonable, were
the Temptation leſs, or the Subject meaner; which
<pb facs="tcp:56561:3"/>
in truth doth ſo much pertain to your Graces In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection,
that to have addreſſed themſelves to any
other, had been an alienation of your Graces Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
and no leſs than Sacrilege. Which being
conſidered, I truſt the apprehended Guilt will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh;
And by that Acceptance, which your Graces
wonted Humanity promiſes, the Crime will borrow
another Name, and be tranſmuted into a Vertue.</p>
            <p>I do not crave your Graces acceptance of theſe
Papers upon any ſcore of their Merit, unto which
they dare not pretend; But do only beſeech that
charitable Kindneſs to be extended to them,
which is due to Strangers: Eſpecially coming ſo
far, and upon ſuch an Errand, as to implore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
for thoſe <hi>Myriads</hi> of hungry and diſtreſſed
Souls abroad; moſt of them within the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Dominion, tho without their Care; and even vaſt
Numbers being no other than our Peoples Slaves
and Vaſſals; but from whom alſo the <hi>Bread of
Life</hi> is moſt ſacrilegiouſly detained. And by this
your Condeſcention and Kindneſs to theſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-Suppliants,
it is not impoſſible, but that Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
may be repeated to you, Of <hi>entertaining An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
The dignity of their Meſſage being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to qualifie them for thoſe Titles and Names,
which otherwiſe they durſt not aſſume, and could
no way challenge.</p>
            <p>It would be but groſs Impertinence for me to
undertake to acquaint your Grace how zealous our
<pb facs="tcp:56561:3"/>
Anceſtors were in promoting Works of this nature,
the advancement of <hi>Religion</hi> in foraign Regions,
even beyond their own Power, and Juriſdiction.
Nor need I to mention how ſome others do make
this very thing an Eſſential Mark of the <hi>Catholic
Church,</hi> and from thence would prove their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
true, and ours, at the ſame time, falſe: And
do therefore conclude that they have ſufficient
grounds to unchurch us, and to determine us no
<hi>Chriſtian Nation.</hi> Nor ſhall I go about to paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
our <hi>Crime</hi> with that of the <hi>Ancient Britains,</hi> it
being indeed much <hi>blacker;</hi> of whom yet <hi>Gildas</hi>
complains (as a moſt grievous Impiety), that they
never took care to preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>Saxons,</hi> their (not Domeſtics and Vaſſals, which
theſe, we ſpeak of, are, but) moſt cruel Invaders
and Oppreſſors; and even to this he aſcribes his
Peoples and Countries overthrow. But inſtead
thereof ſhall offer up my Prayers at the Throne of
Mercy, that the like <hi>fatal,</hi> (but infinitely leſs excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable,)
<hi>Neglect</hi> of our People abroad, not to ſay
at Home alſo, may not prove alike <hi>Ominous,</hi> nor
haſten the accompliſhment of thoſe <hi>Evils,</hi> which
have ſo lately threatned, and do ſtill hang over
us; and of which, 'tis poſſible, that very <hi>miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi>
and <hi>ſcandalous Neglect</hi> has been the
prime occaſion. And at the ſame time bemoan
our hard <hi>Lot</hi> to be born and live in an Age
ſo utterly barren of thoſe <hi>Rich Fruits,</hi> with
which the former did ſo abound: And that when
<pb facs="tcp:56561:4"/>
the moſt <hi>oppoſite Parties</hi> do compaſs Sea and Land
to make <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> We only are charged with the
<hi>Neglect,</hi> I ſhall not add the oppoſing of it; that
being the <hi>Crime</hi> of ſuch degenerated <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who
with that air, have imbibed the Barbarity and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm</hi>
of the Countries they live in: And with
whom, through the want of Diſcipline, <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
doth ſeem to be wholly loſt, and nothing but
<hi>Infidelity</hi> to have come in its place.</p>
            <p>And thus, I have given your Grace the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
inviting me to this bold attempt, together
with tboſe other for this Publication; which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
will not prove ineffectual whilſt your Grace
ſhall continue what you have always been: It being
impoſſible that that flame of <hi>Religious Zeal,</hi> which
hath hitherto ſo vigorouſly acted in your Grace,
ſhould be Extinguiſhed whilſt you are alive; But
muſt needs excite you to further endeavours for
the good of Souls, tho at a remoter diſtance than
both the <hi>India's;</hi> or that you ſhould ſuffer a thing
of that <hi>Conſequence</hi> for to ſleep. Which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
will give you a Name in the bleſſed Records of
Eternity, equal to thoſe Primitive Pious <hi>Biſhops</hi>
and holy <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> who have been moſt Induſtrious
and Vigilant in publiſhing the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and
promoting the <hi>Service</hi> of their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I begin to be tedious, nor will your
Graces occaſions of greateſt Moment, admit of
<pb facs="tcp:56561:4"/>
unneceſſary Avocations: Wherefore (to avoid
being further troubleſome) I ſhall humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe ſtate of Religon in the Plantations is ſuch, as
that to ſtir up all Mens Zeal and Commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there needs no other Argument than its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rightly underſtood and known.</p>
            <p>This is induſtriouſly avoided and prevented by ſuch, who
as public Agents for thoſe parts, ſhould in the firſt place
repreſent the Wants and Grievances thereof; being of
greateſt conſequence both to the Souls of Men, and to the
Government under which they live, and by which they are
Protected and Imployed; and therefore ought in Conſcience
to preſerve it.</p>
            <p>But the Goſpel being become ſtale News, and thoſe glad
Tidings ſounding but as ſome <hi>Anile Fable</hi> or <hi>Dream,</hi>
the neceſſity of this needleſs and troubleſome Charge
about <hi>Religion,</hi> cannot enter into ſuch, who for the moſt
part do know no other <hi>God</hi> but <hi>Money,</hi> nor <hi>Religion</hi> but
<hi>Profit.</hi> Which, with ſome other <hi>prouder</hi> Conſiderations,
provokes them to obſtruct all deſigns for the good of thoſe
Churches, and to report all things already ſo well ſettled,
as not needing the leaſt amendment or alteration. Preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="tcp:56561:5"/>
(belike) that no half-ſtarved Caitiff coming from thoſe
parts, will be ſo hardy as to gain-ſay Men in Authority,
befriended with the Purſes and Power of whole Provinces
to defend them; and thereby enabled to ſupport their
own, and to blaſt any other the moſt innocent Man's Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>But being my ſelf fully perſuaded, that God will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
make good his Promiſe to the World, of cauſing
his Goſpel to be publiſhed, his Name called upon, and
his Church eſtabliſhed among the remoteſt Nations, I
have here attempted to break through this Oppoſition; and
as not knowing how to juſtifie my ſilence, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
might be more ſafe; without any regard to thoſe
Gentlemens diſpleaſure, which I muſt expect even to the
utmoſt degree; I do here tender to the Public this <hi>Plea</hi>
both for the Chriſtianizing of our <hi>Negro's</hi> and other
Heathen in thoſe <hi>Plantations,</hi> and for ſettling (or rather
reviving) of <hi>Religion</hi> amongſt our own People there.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Epidamnians</hi> (a <hi>Colony</hi> alſo,

So I doubt not but, beſides theſe, (which are no leſs true,

            <p>But here 'tis poſſible that they may be apt (as 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

<pb facs="tcp:56561:6"/>
Charge, even to their refuſal of the <hi>Chriſtianizing</hi> of their
<hi>Slaves,</hi> were it a thing leſs known. But this laſt being ſo
manifeſtly true, can any Man once ſo much as doubt of the
reſt? There being (queſtionleſs) nothing ſo black, which
he for his profit (if with impunitie) will not perpetrate,
who, without ſcruple, can ſo glibly ſwallow that Impiety.
Nor is it againſt Charity to think the worſt of one, who,
by that ſingle Omiſſion, lives in a perpetual contempt of
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and hourly affronts that Faith he profeſſeth
to believe. And I do here once for all declare, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Paſſages I have in this Diſcourſe delivered of them,
are either what have proceeded from my own Knowledg,
as being an Eye or Ear Witneſs, and (perhaps) a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
under them; or elſe which have been atteſted to me by
Perſons of as great <hi>Veracity</hi> and <hi>Credit,</hi> as any thoſe
parts do afford, (of whom divers are now reſiding in
<hi>England);</hi> who could have no deſign in the Impoſture, and
therefore are not by me in the leaſt ſuſpected. Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
even themſelves, (unleſs reſolved to be Perjur'd upon
Record), if examined upon Oath, muſt confeſs as much.
Nor do I deſire any thing more, than to be brought upon a
Juſtification; which they cannot but know can never <hi>(here)</hi>
ſucceed to their Advantage. And for their Threats (I
have heard) of throwing <hi>Dirt,</hi> and <hi>ſmiting with their
Tongues,</hi> (beſides that this is <hi>but a ſhifting off of the
Queſtion);</hi> as they ſhall not take me unprepared, ſo let
them know, that whilſt I have this ſhelter to flie unto,
<q xml:lang="lat">Nil conſcire mihi, nullâ &amp; palleſcere culpâ;</q>
the very worſt they can vomit forth will never in the leaſt
prejudice me in the opinion and eſteem of Good Men.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Whereas ſome may perchance object againſt my
ſpending Time in this Diſcourſe to prove the <hi>Negro's
<pb facs="tcp:56561:7"/>
Humanity,</hi> and to ſhew that neither their <hi>Complexion</hi>
nor Bondage, Deſcent nor Country, can be any impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereto. Tho I have ſpoken to it, <hi>Pag.</hi> 13. and
elſe-where, yet here I ſhall further give this Anſwer,
That this is as needful (the contrary being believed, or at
leaſt made a pretence) as any of the reſt. And here let
the Objecters alſo remember, that a thouſand Years ſince, it
had been as ridiculous for any Man to go about to prove that
<hi>Bread</hi> was <hi>Bread,</hi> and not <hi>Fleſh:</hi> Whereas now the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Divines of both the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have though it no diſparagement to their Learning,
to write large Volumns, the one for, but the other
againſt that Faith. And for other (whether Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
or Real) defects in this Diſcourſe, if Charity and
the goodneſs of the Deſign will not veil them, I hope that
at leaſt it may find ſome mitigation of the Cenſure, from
the conſideration of its being written in <hi>Terra barbara.</hi>

               <p>§. 1. IT having been <hi>my Lot</hi> ſince my Arrival upon
<hi>this Iſland,</hi> to fall ſometimes into Diſcourſes
touching the neceſſity of <hi>Inſtructing</hi> our
<hi>Negro's</hi> and other <hi>Heathen</hi> in the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faith,</hi> and of <hi>Baptizing</hi> them (both which I
obſerved were generally neglected;) I ſeldom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56561:9"/>
or never miſſed of oppoſition from ſome one of theſe
three ſorts of People: The firſt, Such, as by reaſon
of the Difficulty and Trouble, affirmed it not only
Impracticable, but alſo Impoſſible. The ſecond, Such
who lookt upon all Deſigns of that Nature, as too
much ſavouring <hi>of Popiſh Supererrogation,</hi> and not in the
leaſt Expedient or Neceſſary. The third, Such (and
theſe I found the moſt numerous) who abſolutely
condemned both the Permiſſion and Practice thereof,
as deſtructive to their Intereſt, tending to no leſs Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
than the overthrow of their Eſtates, and the
ruine of their <hi>Lives,</hi> threatning even the utter <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi>
of the Iſland. Who therefore have always
been very watchful to ſecure that Door, and wiſely to
prevent all <hi>ſuch miſchievous Enterprizes.</hi> Themſelves
in the mean time imploying their utmoſt Skill and
Activity <hi>to render the Deſign Ridiculous,</hi> thereby to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
the better diſpoſed (if any) from ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
to an Act, which, beyond all peradventure,
would ſo much call their <hi>Diſcretion and Wiſdom</hi> into
Queſtion.</p>
               <p>2. This ſpirit of <hi>Gentiliſm</hi> (for that is the mildeſt
Name it will deſerve) was principally occaſioned
through the want of care in the ſeating of theſe <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,</hi>
where <hi>Religion</hi> ought to have been planted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the firſt Inhabitants; as amongſt <hi>all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
beſides our ſelves,</hi> hath elſewhere been generally
practiſed: But the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for being of the <hi>beſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
are to be excuſed. 'Tis true, the <hi>Negro's</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of our Language was for ſome time a real <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment</hi>
thereto, and ſo long a tolerable plea for the
<hi>Omiſſion;</hi> but none afterward, when they had arrived
to an ability of Underſtanding, and diſcourſing in
<hi>Engliſh</hi> equal with moſt of our <hi>own People;</hi> which
<hi>many thouſands</hi> of them long ſince have: Whilſt now
after ſuch a long Risk <hi>of Licentiouſneſs, an ungodly Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56561:9"/>
grown ſtrong, is kept as a Law:</hi> To gain-ſay which
is lookt upon as no leſs <hi>impious,</hi> than elſewhere it is
(and formerly it univerſally was) <hi>reputed Meritorious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Now to repreſent this more plauſible to the
World, another no leſs diſingenuous and unmanly
<hi>Poſition</hi> hath been formed; and privately <hi>(and as it
were in the dark)</hi> handed to and again, which is this,
That the <hi>Negro's,</hi> though in their Figure they carry
ſome reſemblances of Manhood, yet are indeed <hi>no
Men.</hi> A Conceit like unto which I have read, was
ſome time ſince invented by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to juſtifie
<hi>their murthering the Americans.</hi> But for this here, I
may ſay, that if <hi>Atheiſm and Irreligion</hi> were the true
Parents who gave it Life, ſurely <hi>Sloth and Avarice</hi> have
been no unhandy Inſtruments and Aſſiſtants to mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
it into the World, and to Foſter and Nurſe it up.
Under whoſe Protection getting abroad, it hath acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſufficient ſtrength and reputation to ſupport it ſelf;
being now able not only to maintain its ground,
but to bid defiance to all its <hi>Oppoſers;</hi> who in truth are
found to be but very <hi>few,</hi> and thoſe ſcarcely <hi>conſiderable.</hi>
The iſſue whereof is, That as in the <hi>Negroe's all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to Religion</hi> is cut off, ſo their <hi>Owners</hi> are hereby
ſet at Liberty, and freed from thoſe importunate Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
which Conſcience and better Advice might at
any time happen to inject into their unſteadie Minds.
A <hi>Fiction</hi> hardly to be parallel'd throughout the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of the <hi>Poets;</hi> and which I preſume never before
found entertainment amongſt any, beſide thoſe above
mentioned; or perhaps our <hi>Neighbours of</hi> Holland,
<hi>whoſe Religion is alſo governed by their Trade,</hi> and (as
hath, I fear, been <hi>too juſtly charged</hi> upon them) for
the ſake thereof ſhall be <hi>denied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Now whilſt in my thoughts I reflected upon
theſe wild <hi>Fancies</hi> and abſurd <hi>Poſitions,</hi> which I had
often heard (tho not in expreſs words, yet in <hi>terms
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56561:10"/>
equivalent)</hi> no leſs impudently urged and aſſerted,
than I ſaw <hi>univerſally practiſed.</hi> A petty <hi>Reformado</hi>
Pamphlet was put into my hand by an <hi>officious
FRIEND,</hi> or <hi>Quaker</hi> of this Iſland, (I ſuppoſe, in
order to my <hi>Converſion);</hi> upon the peruſal whereof,
which was ſtrictly enjoyned me, I met with this maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
(but crafty) <hi>Invective,</hi> levelled againſt the <hi>Miniſters,</hi>
to whom it was by the way of <hi>Interrogatory,</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and applied in no other than theſe words: <q>
                     <hi>Who
made you Miniſters of the Goſpel to the White People only,
and not to the Tawneys and Blacks alſo?</hi>
                  </q> (with many
other the like inſolent <hi>Queries,</hi> following in a <hi>tedious
Harangue,</hi> I think, to this effect, for I ſhall not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to rehearſe his words exactly):<q>Why do you
not teach your People in this part of their Duty, or
at leaſt ſhew them the way by <hi>your Example, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at HOME with thoſe of your OWN FAMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIES,</hi>

that you ſpend ſo much time in Railing againſt
us, whom you call <hi>Quakers,</hi> and other peaceable
People; but where there <hi>is Occaſion,</hi> have not a word
to ſay? As if this Ignorance of Chriſt in them were
not as well worth your Pains and falſe Zeal, as the
beating down of Phanaticiſm, as you are pleaſed to
term Innocent People's belief and perſuaſions? Doth
not <hi>this ſilence</hi> proceed from a <hi>fear of Men,</hi> whom
you are loth to diſpleaſe by this Doctrine, for what
covetous ends your ſelves beſt know? And do you
not thereby teſtifie that you are <hi>Men-pleaſers</hi> and

falſely pretend <hi>Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who, as

came to <hi>Redeem all Mankind,</hi> without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>NEGRO'S and INDIANS?</hi> And therefore
his <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were by him commanded

                     <hi>to preach the Goſpel to all the World, and to be Witneſſes

way to ſet forward the Salvation of <hi>all Men;</hi> and to
make the Ways of God and of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> known
unto <hi>all Nations, and to all Conditions</hi> of Men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
not omitting <hi>Slaves,</hi> nor any other? Is this to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the Way of Jeſus Chriſt againſt his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to judge the World, <hi>by turning the Hearts of the
Diſobedient to the wiſdom of the Juſt,</hi> and to approve
your ſelves faithful and true Paſtours, earneſtly feeding
the Flock of Chriſt, and preaching his Word unto
them, as in your <hi>Collects</hi> (as you call them) you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to pray? Is this to follow the Saints in all
Godly and Vertuous Living, who as you reade, <hi>Mark
the 16th and the laſt Verſe, went forth preaching every
where,</hi> and ventured their Lives into all the World
to preach the Goſpel to the Heathen, when you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
it in your <hi>Pariſhes and Families?</hi> Is this to take
upon you the Office of a Miniſter, to ſerve God for
the promoting of his Glory, and the edifying of his
People committed to your care and charge? Is this
to be ready with all faithful diligence to uſe both
publick and private Monitions and Exhortations,
as well to the Sick, as to the whole within your
Cures? Is this to be diligent to frame and faſhion
your own <hi>Lives and your Families</hi> according to the
Doctrine of Chriſt, and to make both your ſelves
and them, as much as in you lieth, wholeſome <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
and Patterns</hi> to the Flock of Chriſt, laying

you will be contented to work in Chriſt's <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi>

The <hi>Duties</hi> there by him urged, (tho doubtleſs with
curſt intent, and as <hi>Judas</hi> became Spokeſman and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<hi>for the Poor)</hi> being evident from the avowed <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
of all Chriſtians; no leſs then from <hi>the expreſs
words of our own Liturgie,</hi> by him collected from the
ſeveral parts thereof: As will be ſeen upon the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
of the Collect for the <hi>Ember Weeks,</hi> the general
Prayer <hi>for all conditions of Men,</hi> the Collect for <hi>Good
Friday,</hi> that for the <hi>ſecond Sunday in Advent,</hi> and for
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, and <hi>All-Saints Days;</hi> and laſtly, from the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſes</hi>
in the Book of <hi>Ordination of Prieſts and Deacons.</hi>
And the <hi>Neglect</hi> reprehended, being too apparent to
be either ſhifted off, or <hi>extenuated</hi> by any palliation,
or excuſe.</p>
               <p>5. Now upon this I began to queſtion with my ſelf,
If the Goſpel be <hi>good Tidings,</hi> why ſhould it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
or hid? And ſince deſigned ſo <hi>to all People,</hi>
why ſhould not theſe partake of it as well as others?
If we are bound to <hi>pray</hi> for their Converſion, why
are we not alſo to <hi>endeavour</hi> it? And ſince that our
Bleſſed Lord commanded his Apoſtles, St. <hi>Mat. 28. to
go and make Diſciples of ALL the Heathen,</hi> why may it
not be alike lawful for me, with the great Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi>
2. 8. to both argue and conclude, <hi>In that he ſaid All,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56561:11"/>
he had excepted none?</hi> I then alſo fell to reflect upon the
Doom of the <hi>unprofitable Servant;</hi> and that ſince Chriſt
had been thus merciful to me, <hi>putting me into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi>
ſo unworthy of it; I could have no pretence to
be ſilent; and that I ought not <hi>to lay my</hi> (tho ſlender)
<hi>Talent up in a Napkin,</hi> leſt thereby I ſhould juſtly incur
the like ſad Doom. And withal, obſerving that no
abler <hi>Advocate</hi> for them had appeared, I concluded my
ſelf under ſome Obligation, to endeavour to wipe off
theſe Blemiſhes, and to repair the Honour of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Profeſſion.</hi> But withal, chiefly to admoniſh
<hi>our People</hi> of this Neglect; and if <hi>poſſible,</hi> to convince
them of the wickedneſs of thoſe horrid <hi>Poſitions</hi> and
<hi>Principles</hi> before mentioned; as alſo of the neceſſity
of their <hi>ſpeedy applying</hi> themſelves to that great Duty
hitherto ſo <hi>unchriſtianly omitted.</hi> Whereupon my
thoughts after ſome time, reſolved themſelves into
theſe three general <hi>Aſſertions.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the <hi>Negro's</hi> (both Slaves and others) have
naturally an <hi>equal Right</hi> with other Men to the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
and Privileges</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> of which 'tis
moſt unjuſt in any part to deprive them.</item>
                  <item>2. That the <hi>profeſſion of Chriſtianity</hi> abſolutely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
to the promoting of it, no <hi>Difficulties</hi> nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
how great ſoever, can excuſe the <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi>
much leſs the <hi>hindering</hi> or <hi>oppoſing</hi> of it,
which is in effect no better than a renunciation of that
Profeſſion.</item>
                  <item>3. That the Inconveniencies here pretended for this Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
being <hi>examined,</hi> will be found nothing ſuch,
but rather the contrary.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this I do the more confidently here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
from the encouragement and counſel of the</hi>
Wiſe Man, Eccleſ. 11. 6. <hi>thus adviſing:</hi> In the morning
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56561:12"/>
ſow thy ſeed, and in the evening withhold not thine
Hand, for thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper, either
this or that, or whether they both ſhall prove alike
good. <hi>And as not in the leaſt deſpairing of a due ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
tho even</hi> Briars and Thorns ſhould be with me, and
my dwelling ſhould be among Scorpions; <hi>ſince the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
hath by the Mouth of his Evangelical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
given us this aſſurance,</hi> Iſa. 55. That as the Rain
cometh down, and the Snow from Heaven, and returneth
not thither, but watereth the Earth, and maketh it bring
forth and bud, that it may give Seed to the ſower, and
Bread to the eater: So ſhall my Word be, that goeth forth
out of my Mouth; it ſhall not return unto me void, but
it ſhall accompliſh that which I pleaſe, and it ſhall proſper
in the thing whereunto I ſent it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That the Negro's (both Slaves and others)
have naturally an equal Right with other Men,
to the Exerciſe and Privileges of Religion;
of which 'tis moſt unjuſt in any part to deprive
them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. ANd thus our <hi>Negro's</hi> and <hi>Indian's</hi> caſe as to
Religion being ſum'd up and truly ſtated,
and our People's temper and inclination towards the
Converſion of them being repreſented; I betake my
ſelf to my firſt general Aſſertion; which I ſhall divide
into theſe three <hi>Propoſitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>naturally</hi> there is in every Man an
equal <hi>Right to Religion.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Negro's</hi> are Men, and therefore
are inveſted with the <hi>ſame Right.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That being thus qualified and inveſted,
to deprive them of this <hi>Right</hi> is the <hi>higheſt
injuſtice.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1. For the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz. That naturally there is
in every Man ſuch a Right:</hi> There are none can eaſily
doubt, who do underſtand either <hi>what Religion is,</hi> or
the true end <hi>for which Man was made;</hi> namely, <hi>to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
and ſerve God;</hi> which is no other than to be <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</hi>
Now this being the certain <hi>End</hi> for which Man
was made, a <hi>Right</hi> to perform that <hi>End</hi> cannot be
denied him.</p>
               <p>2. Which <hi>Right</hi> was not ſuperinduced as an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
ſupply of any imaginary defects of his Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but was at firſt planted and formed in him. Nor
doth he injoy it in common with other <hi>Animals,</hi> but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56561:13"/>
claims it as his ſpecial Privilege peculiar to him <hi>[as
Man],</hi> and in a diſtinct manner from the reſt of the
Creation: Nothing here beſides being indued with
a Capacity ſuitable, and therefore not <hi>pretending</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>3. And as Man alone lays claim to this high <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi>
ſo it is moſt certainly <hi>every Man's,</hi> there being
none ſo deſpicable or baſe, but hath as unqueſtionable
a <hi>Right</hi> thereto, as the moſt illuſtrious and wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſo;
holding the ſame equally and <hi>in common</hi> with
all others of the like <hi>ſpecies</hi> with himſelf. The reaſon
whereof is, becauſe he claims it upon the account of
his being Man, and only <hi>[as ſuch]</hi> hath that Right.
Now, <hi>Quatenus &amp; de omni reciprocantur:</hi> As alſo, <hi>A
quatenus ad omne valet conſequentia,</hi> ſay the Logicians:
That is, whatſoever is avouchable of any Creature
<hi>[as ſuch],</hi> muſt be equally true of every individual
Branch and Member of the <hi>whole kind or ſpecies;</hi> all
being equal ſharers in thoſe <hi>common</hi> gifts of <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. As for Inſtance: The <hi>ſenſitive Faculties,</hi> as See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Hearing, Smelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As alſo the natural <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite</hi>
to Food, deſire of Sleep and Reſt, with other
the like <hi>affections,</hi> are common to all <hi>Animals;</hi> but not
to <hi>Plants</hi> or <hi>Vegetables,</hi> becauſe <hi>peculiar</hi> only to the
other. Theſe they do claim <hi>[as ſuch],</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may not be denied to any the moſt inconſiderable
<hi>Animal</hi> of the whole Creation. For being thereof
once deprived, they inſtantly ceaſe to be, or to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<hi>[ſuch.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Even ſo, <hi>Ex tot generibus nullum eſt Animal,</hi> &amp;c.
ſaid the <hi>Roman Orator;</hi> Of all Creatures here below,
Man only hath the notion of a <hi>Deity,</hi> and a propriety
in <hi>Religion.</hi> Which <hi>Right and Propriety</hi> doth belong
unto him only upon the account of his being Man;
that is, becauſe he is endued with a reaſonable and
immortal Soul, which alone conſtitutes him <hi>a Man,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56561:13"/>
and capacitates him for <hi>Religion.</hi> For without this he
were not <hi>a Man;</hi> could neither be <hi>ſubject</hi> to Laws or
<hi>Diſcipline,</hi> nor capable of <hi>Rewards</hi> or Puniſhments af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this Life: Nor in a word, could be any longer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated,
<hi>à grege brutorum,</hi> as the Poet ſpeaks: Above
whom he is only advanced by that Prerogative of
<hi>Reaſon</hi> implanted in his Soul, the only proper and apt
ſeat for <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. For that the Soul of Man is that alone, which
qualifies and enables him to be <hi>Religious,</hi> and that
Man's groſſer and heavier parts do contribute nothing
thereunto, is manifeſt: For that <hi>Religion</hi> being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
wherein the Mind and Underſtanding only are
concerned, the Body abſtracted from theſe, (by whom
it is to be led and directed) can ſupply no other part
in this Work, than of a ſecondary Agent therein, and
as <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to the other. For otherwiſe <hi>Atheiſts,</hi>
and reſolved wicked Men, <hi>might ſerve God</hi> and be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious;
whilſt like <hi>Engines</hi> compelled thereto, their
Bodies ſhewed ſome little compliance with the preſent
Action, ſo far as <hi>outward Geſtures</hi> would go; tho they
believed nothing of the work they were about: and
even a Beaſt might be taught to do the like; but could
never be governed <hi>by Laws,</hi> be reduced under <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi>
and <hi>Government</hi> (of which Man by his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is alone capable) or be ſubject to the <hi>impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Conſcience;</hi> have a proſpect of Happineſs, or
be apprehenſive of future Dangers and Contingencies;
much leſs be able to provide againſt them. All theſe
Faculties being peculiar to the <hi>Rational Being,</hi> or Soul,
ſeated in Man only: Of whoſe <hi>Species,</hi> if our <hi>Negro's</hi>
can be truly ſaid to partake, then will it of neceſſity
follow, that they are <hi>Originally</hi> ſtated in the like <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Right</hi> to the Privileges of <hi>Religion.</hi> The thing
that I am next to prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56561:14"/>
§. II. 1. I muſt confeſs the <hi>Antecedent</hi> is by our
<hi>Anti-Religioniſts,</hi> (as was at firſt remembred) and
even by ſome others who would be thought leſs Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<hi>to Piety,</hi> with no ſmall reſolution oppoſed, tho
not always expreſsly, yet in words equivalent, and
withal moſt fully explained by their ſubſequent daily
Practice. Which Practice, becauſe their words may
be capable of a milder conſtruction, (tho in this caſe
not in the leaſt deſerving it); I intend for the ſole,
at leaſt chief Rule or Meaſure to judge of and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the other. And here let no one account it
incredible, that <hi>Intereſt</hi> ſhould ſeduce Men into ſuch a
<hi>monſtrous opinion,</hi> (which divers even in <hi>England</hi> have
been heard to defend) and (as prejudging the cauſe
and matter) conclude it time miſpent, in labouring
to refute it: But remember how much <hi>ſtranger opinions,</hi>
a much greater part of the World upon the like Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
have elſewhere, <hi>tho in another kind,</hi> embraced.
And as to this, there wanting not <hi>Irrational</hi> Creatures,
ſuch as the Ape and Drill, that do carry with them
ſome reſemblances of Men. The too frequent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
conjunctions (as <hi>Taverneir</hi> diſcourſeth in his
Voyages) of ſome <hi>Africans</hi> with thoſe Creatures,
(tho not ſo as to Unpeople that great Continent) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
occaſion for ſuch ſurmiſes as to ſome few <hi>there,</hi> tho
never of any that were brought <hi>hither;</hi> our <hi>Factors</hi>
being too worldly wiſe to commit ſuch groſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights
in their <hi>Civil</hi> Affairs, whatever greater may eſcape
them in their <hi>Spiritual.</hi> And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> queſtion
(which the ſame <hi>Taverneir</hi> alſo mentions) touching the
Brutality of the <hi>Americans,</hi> (and, which I have heard
was held in the <hi>Affirmative</hi> in one of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities
of Spain)</hi> ſerving not a little to make my report more
credible; and to acquit me of all <hi>fictitious Romancing</hi>
herein. Wherefore it being granted for poſſible that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56561:14"/>
ſuch wild Opinions, by the inducement and inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Planters chief
Deity,<note place="margin">Since my return to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Reverend D. of <hi>H.</hi> told me, that an Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of <hi>B</hi> being by himſelf urged to get his <hi>Attendant Negro's</hi> Baptized, made the like Objections, with thoſe which he found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in the Papers I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, which were no other than a part of this Book. And tho ſuch Practices may ſeem ſtrange to People in <hi>England,</hi> yet the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons going thither are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly changed, ſo that they make nothing of it.</note> 
                  <hi>Profit,</hi> may have lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
themſelves in the Brains
of ſome of us; I ſhall not
fear to betake my ſelf to the
refuting of this one which
I have ſpoken of. For the
effecting of which, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
the conſideration of
the ſhape and figure of our
<hi>Negro's</hi> Bodies, their Limbs
and Members; their Voice
and Countenance, in all
things according with other
Mens; together with their
<hi>Riſibility</hi> and <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> (Man's <hi>peculiar</hi> Faculties)
ſhould be a ſufficient Conviction. How ſhould they
otherwiſe be capable of <hi>Trades,</hi> and other no leſs Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imployments; as alſo of <hi>Reading and Writing;</hi> or
ſhew ſo much Diſcretion in management of Buſineſs;
eminent in divers of them; but wherein (we know)
that many of our own People are <hi>deficient,</hi> were they
not truly Men? Theſe being the moſt clear <hi>emanations</hi>
and reſults of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and therefore the moſt genuine
and perfect characters of <hi>Homoniety,</hi> if I may ſo ſpeak.
Or why ſhould they be tormented and whipt almoſt
(and ſometimes quite) to death, upon any, whether
<hi>ſmall or great</hi> Miſcarriages, it is not material, were they
(like Brutes) naturally deſtitute of <hi>Capacities</hi> equal to
ſuch undertakings? Or why ſhould their <hi>Owners,</hi>
Men of Reaſon no doubt, conceive them fit to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
the place of Governours and <hi>Overſeers</hi> to their <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Slaves,</hi> which is frequently done, if they were but
meer Brutes? Since nothing beneath the <hi>Capacity</hi> of
a Man might rationally be preſumed proper for thoſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56561:15"/>
Duties and Functions, wherein ſo much of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and a more than <hi>ordinary</hi> Apprehenſion is
required. It would certainly be a pretty kind of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical</hi>
Frenzie, to imploy Cattel about Buſineſs, and
to conſtitute them <hi>Lieutenants, Overſeers,</hi> and <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi>
like as <hi>Domitian</hi> is ſaid to have made his Horſe
a <hi>Conſul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Their Objections againſt this, are poor and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial;
yet becauſe with a great many here, ſeeming to
carry no little weight, (for otherwiſe they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
both argue and act ſo abſurdly, as they do); And
becauſe found ſerviceable to their great <hi>End,</hi> which I
have before ſpoken of, not rejected by the Wiſer; they
muſt not, <hi>ſilly and idle as they be,</hi> for theſe Reaſons be
ſlighted. They are of divers ſorts. The firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are certain impertinent and blaſphemous <hi>diſtortions
of Scripture;</hi> out of which they would fain bribe
four places, to wit, in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 1. 27, 28. and 2. 7.
and 4. 15. and laſtly, 9. 25, 26. to give in <hi>evidence</hi>
for them. Now in the two firſt of theſe they ſtrain
hard to derive our <hi>Negro's</hi> from a ſtock <hi>different</hi> from
<hi>Adam</hi>'s: but by the third, they beſpeak them as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendents
from <hi>Cain,</hi> and to carry his <hi>Mark:</hi> And yet
by the laſt, as if <hi>condemned</hi> to contradictions, they
make them the Poſterity of that unhappy Son of <hi>Noah,</hi>
who, they ſay, was, together with his whole <hi>Family</hi>
and Race, <hi>curſed</hi> by his <hi>Father.</hi> Of which <hi>Curſe</hi> 'tis
worth the obſerving what <hi>bleſſed uſe</hi> they to themſelves
do make, and what variety of advantages they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
reap. For from thence, as occaſion ſhall offer,
they'll infer their <hi>Negro's Brutality;</hi> juſtifie their
reduction of them under Bondage; diſable them from
all <hi>Right and Claims,</hi> even to <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them <hi>Reprobates,</hi> and upon a ſudden (with
greater ſpeed and cunning than either the nimbleſt
Jugler, or Witch) <hi>tranſmute</hi> them into whatſoever
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56561:15"/>
ſubſtance the <hi>exigence</hi> of their wild reaſonings ſhall
drive them to.</p>
               <p>3. I confeſs, as for the third of theſe, which is
<hi>Cain's Mark,</hi> they inſiſt not much upon it, becauſe
thwarting their <hi>Pre-Adamitiſm,</hi> of which they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
fond, tho many times 'tis by their leſs skilful
Diſputants <hi>preſt to the Service.</hi> But the <hi>Pre-Adamites</hi>
whimſey, which is preferred above the <hi>Curſe</hi> (becauſe
ſo exceeding uſeful to undermine the <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
unto both which they have vowed never to be
<hi>reconciled)</hi> they believe invincible; tho upon but a
very ſuperficial trial, found (as will inſtantly appear)
to be in ſome things <hi>falſe,</hi> in other, <hi>empty</hi> and <hi>ſilly;</hi> but
in nothing, of any conſiderable <hi>weight</hi> or moment.
For the fuller proof whereof, I ſhall crave leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the <hi>Reader</hi> to that no leſs <hi>Learned</hi> than <hi>Judicious</hi>
Perſon, <hi>Judge Hales,</hi> in his Book lately publiſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Origination of Man,</hi> wherein the whole
<hi>Myſtery</hi> of that foul <hi>Hereſie</hi> is unravelled, and moſt
ſtrongly refuted.</p>
               <p>4. But that I may not ſeem wholly to ſhift my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
off to that <hi>Reverend</hi> Author, and as it were ſhelter
my <hi>ſloth and ignorance</hi> (which laſt doth, I confeſs,
ſtand in need of ſuch an able <hi>Supporter)</hi> under his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Pen, I ſhall beg his patience a little, whilſt I take
upon me to entertain him with ſome two or three of
that learned Doctor's <hi>Arguments,</hi> who was the firſt
<hi>Author</hi> of that Opinion; all by him borrowed from
<hi>Gen. 4. 2. &amp;c.</hi> from whence he undertakes to confirm
his unheard of <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Of which, the firſt I ſhall attempt to unbowel
is that, wherein he takes it for granted, (I cannot
point out the <hi>Chapter</hi> and <hi>Page,</hi> it being long ſince I
read it) that before the <hi>commencement</hi> of that <hi>Hiſtory,</hi>
there muſt be a numerous race of Men, not derivable
from <hi>Adam.</hi> For firſt he there obſerves, that <hi>Abel
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56561:16"/>
was a Keeper</hi> (the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as our Margen alſo directs
us, ſaith a <hi>Feeder) of Sheep.</hi> This without more ado
he concludes was to <hi>ſecure</hi> them, not from ſtraying or
being devoured by Wolves, but from being <hi>ſtolen:</hi>
And by whom? Not by his <hi>Parents,</hi> or <hi>Brother,</hi> that
being unlikely; but by other Sheep-ſtealing <hi>Rovers</hi> of
the pretended former <hi>Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Secondly, he obſerves from the ſame Chapter, that
<hi>Cain was a Tiller of Ground,</hi> that is, an Husbandman.
This, ſaith he, doth ſuppoſe divers <hi>Trades</hi> to be at
the ſame time in being; to wit, <hi>Smiths, Plow-Wrights,
Carpenters,</hi> &amp;c. to furniſh him with Inſtruments of
Husbandry. (The like he might have inferred, and
'twas a groſs overſight if he did not, from <hi>Adam</hi>'s
being put to dreſs <hi>Eden; Gardening-Tools</hi> (tho 'tis ſaid,
<hi>that there was not a Man to make them)</hi> being as requiſite
for that work, as <hi>Plows</hi> for the other). But had this
learned Man travelled the more Southern parts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica;</hi>
or moſt, if not all the parts of <hi>America;</hi> he
might perhaps there have learned a more <hi>Orthodox
Comment</hi> upon theſe <hi>Texts,</hi> and more decently have
ſolved his Doubts. For there he might have beheld
the <hi>Natives</hi> (probably ſtill retaining the faſhion of
thoſe <hi>Elder</hi> times) planting each Man his own provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Maiz;</hi> room being firſt made for the Seed to
paſs into the Ground with no ſubtiler <hi>Engine</hi> than a
ſimple Stick thruſt into it, or it may be with his <hi>Finger:</hi>
And after this weeding his Corn with <hi>Fiſh ſhells,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>Hoa's,</hi> uſed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and other wiſer
People. And this they ſtill practiſe, without craving
the leaſt aſſiſtance (unleſs, poſſibly, ſome few of them
ſince our Arrival) from thoſe Trades; of which, as
indeed of almoſt all other, they are wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
               <p>7. Thirdly, turning to the <hi>Septuagint</hi> Bible, he there
reades that <hi>Cain,</hi> talking with his Brother, invites him
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56561:16"/>
in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to go into
the Field. From which Clauſe, not found in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi>
he is ſure they muſt needs at that time dwell in
ſome <hi>Town</hi> or <hi>City,</hi> not ſo ſoon to be built by <hi>Adam's
thin Race.</hi> And therefore other <hi>Architects</hi> and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
muſt be fetcht from that imaginary <hi>Elder Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
But this <hi>Logic,</hi> even admitting that Clauſe,
would never hold in <hi>Virginia,</hi> where there is neither
Town nor City (their <hi>Metropolis</hi> excepted, lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of ſome twelve or fourteen Families, but ſince
the late <hi>Rebellion</hi> and Burning of it, I ſuppoſe of few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
throughout that, nor even the Neighbouring
<hi>Provinces.</hi> And even in this <hi>Iſland,</hi> we know that
Men do not always take their way thorow the
<hi>Bridg-Town</hi> into their <hi>Plantations.</hi> And no more
neceſſity was there for <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi>'s not doing the
ſame. And here alſo the <hi>Natives</hi> (and I ſhall ſuppoſe
no leſs of the South of <hi>Africa)</hi> could have taught
him to erect places for Shelter and Lodging, ſuch as
'tis poſſible both <hi>Adam</hi> and his <hi>Children</hi> for a long time
might be contented with, without the aid of <hi>Maſons</hi>
or other <hi>Builders,</hi> than what were needful for plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of <hi>Arbours,</hi> covered only with <hi>Leaves,</hi> or the <hi>Bark</hi>
of Trees, which generally are the <hi>Royal Manſions</hi> and
<hi>Baſilicks</hi> of their greateſt Kings and Emperours. But
this <hi>Eutopian</hi> or <hi>Atlantean</hi> City, having no Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nor being, any where extant, but in our <hi>Quixots
rambling Fancy,</hi> there is no need to produce either
Builders, or Inhabitants for it.</p>
               <p>8. However, to put an end to this Diſpute: There
is no doubt but that theſe places in <hi>Geneſis, viz.</hi> Chap.
2. 5. &amp; 3. 20. &amp; 7. 21, 22, 23. and 10. 32. All
levelled as it were expreſly againſt this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Pre-Adamitiſm,</hi> (as the learned <hi>Judge</hi> hath
obſerved) do certainly carry in them no leſs truth,
than thoſe other, which its firſt Author, (contrary to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56561:17"/>
the ſenſe and judgment of the whole World, both
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who have gone before him) hath
<hi>wreſted</hi> to that his wicked purpoſe; and ought with
as great certainty to be believed. So alſo doth Saint
<hi>Paul</hi>'s affirmation at <hi>Athens,</hi> in the hearing of the Wits
and Virtuoſi there, (who refuſed not to acquieſce
with him in the ſame judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>That God had made
[of one Blood] all Nations of Men, for to dwell on all the
face of the Earth,</hi> Acts 17. 26. I ſay, theſe with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other weighty Arguments and Teſtimonies from
<hi>ſacred Scripture,</hi> ought to challenge from us at leaſt an
equal meaſure of credit with thoſe Dreams of that
<hi>Fantaſtic Author:</hi> And may no leſs at the ſame time
inform us, how misbecoming <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
it is (without conſideration of what may be ſaid on
either ſide) in a moment to run down and explode
ſuch <hi>ancient received Principles,</hi> for an irrational <hi>Novelty,</hi>
never before thought on; and thus to ſhake the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Chriſtian Faith, only to gratifie a <hi>ſilly
Humour,</hi> and to ſhew <hi>how bold they dare be with the
Almighty.</hi> Who yet, if they are reſolved not to be
ſatisfied with the Account which <hi>Moſes</hi> gives of the
Creation, as hitherto it hath been generally underſtood
and received; It much ſtands them upon ſince, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the <hi>Old,</hi> to find out a <hi>New</hi> and better; which,
to give them their due, they do not in the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to, beyond <hi>bare</hi> and <hi>empty</hi> Conjectures, void of
all <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Reaſon:</hi> Which tho <hi>themſelves</hi> may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
they muſt allow <hi>others</hi> a due liberty, at the ſame
time, to eſteem <hi>ridiculous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. But here, (after this Deviation to return to the
matter in hand) we are to take notice that their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<hi>Pre-Adamitiſm,</hi> doth not at all prejudice, nor
even relate to this Queſtion, which is touching the
<hi>Homoniety</hi> of our <hi>Negro's,</hi> not their <hi>Origination</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent.</hi>
That Creation which they pretend to be <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:56561:17"/>
to <hi>Adam</hi>'s, being, according to the Principle
of its firſt Author, no leſs of <hi>Real</hi> Men than this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
their Poſterity therefore muſt needs be ſuch. And
our cauſe hath this further Advantage, that as <hi>Cham</hi>'s
<hi>African</hi> Race, and the <hi>Curſe</hi> ſaid to be annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
do make nothing againſt our <hi>American</hi> (nor yet
<hi>Aſian)</hi> Slaves, nor Tributaries; ſo this <hi>Pre-Adami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi>
doth utterly evacuate and overthrow whatever
they from thence might otherwiſe <hi>infer,</hi> tho in it ſelf
never ſo concluſive and good.</p>
               <p>10. Nor are they like to ſpeed better from the Ninth,
than from the three former <hi>Chapters;</hi> unleſs they can
make it appear that that Curſe did deprive all <hi>Cham</hi>'s
Poſterity of their Reaſon, and ſo metamorphoſe them
into Brutes. Nor yet even ſo will it do their Work,
unleſs they alſo prove that all <hi>Negro's,</hi> whereſoever
found, are his Poſterity, and particularly Deſcendents
from <hi>Canaan,</hi> againſt whom alone that Curſe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
(as in the progreſs of this Diſcourſe I ſhall
ſhew) which will be no very eaſie task. But this I ſhall
refer to the next Section to be further conſidered;
what at preſent I ſhall think requiſite to be ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only this, that ſince <hi>Man alone is capable of Diſcipline,</hi>
of which our <hi>Negro's,</hi> equally with other People, are:
Nothing but Malice can be ſuppoſed to beſpeak them
leſs, which even at the ſame time muſt be thought to
<hi>bely it ſelf.</hi> And ſo for the preſent letting this and
ſuch other Arguments reſt, which they pretend to
borrow from the Holy Scripture, where in truth not
the leaſt <hi>ſyllable</hi> can be wreſted ſo as to favour this their
brutiſh <hi>ſuppoſition;</hi> I ſhall proceed to examine whether
the voice of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the thing they ſo mightily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to, will determine more on their behalf, than
ether <hi>Religion,</hi> or the <hi>ſacred Writ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. For to do them Right even in this ſo bad a
Cauſe, they are not of thoſe who ſhun to anſwer at
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56561:18"/>
this Bar, ſo long as they have any thing which they
imagine will make for them, there to be inſiſted on.
But here at laſt failing, which, 'tis to be preſumed,
<hi>in ſuch a Caſe</hi> they cannot but ſoon do, we may the
leſs blame them, if, for their ultimate refuge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
they betake themſelves to <hi>Railing,</hi> or even to
worſe <hi>Arguments.</hi> Their ſpecious <hi>Reaſons</hi> on which this
pious belief is grounded, do ſeem to have been drawn
from theſe four <hi>Pretences;</hi> the Complexion, Bondage,
Pretended Stupidity, and Barbarouſneſs of our <hi>Negro's</hi>
Manners, becauſe different from ours. Of the ſecond
of which, they make this <hi>two-fold <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> firſt to <hi>Bruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>
them; and then, that proving defective, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
them of all both <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Rights,</hi>
which their Manhood, notwithſtanding their being
Slaves, would otherwiſe infer: Of which laſt, I ſhall
ſpeak in its proper place, and in the mean time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
only what relates to the <hi>preſent</hi> Matter.</p>
               <p>12. I ſhall begin with the firſt, and that is their
<hi>Complexion,</hi> which being moſt obvious to the ſight, by
which the <hi>Notion</hi> of things doth ſeem to be moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
conveyed to the Underſtanding, is apt to make
no <hi>ſlight</hi> impreſſions upon rude Minds, already prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to admit of any thing for <hi>Truth</hi> which ſhall make
for Intereſt, eſpecially if ſupported with but the
leaſt <hi>ſhadow of Argument:</hi> And therefore it may not
be ſo improbable (as I have (elſewhere) heard affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
that from ſo poor a <hi>Medium,</hi> our <hi>Negro's</hi> Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
ſhould be inferred, by ſuch whoſe affection to
ſo <hi>gainful</hi> a Doctrine, cannot but make the Way
ſmooth and eaſie to their Conviction. Such People
in theſe Caſes being not apt to reflect, <hi>(and, probably
not caring)</hi> how derogatory to the Goodneſs and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi>
of God it is, to repreſent him thus idly Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to empty <hi>Shadows,</hi> and even to White and Red,
that ſo out of his infinite regard thereto, he ſhould
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56561:18"/>
throw off all <hi>reſpect to the Work of his Hand,</hi> and to
unman and unſoul ſo great a part of the Creation.
Nor yet, (which is more ſtrange, becauſe their own
immediate concern) that the Argument may come
one Day to be turned againſt themſelves, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to chaſtiſe their <hi>Brutiſhneſs,</hi> who from thence did
at firſt ſo maliciouſly infer that <hi>abſurd</hi> Concluſion to
the prejudice of ſo numerous and vaſt a People.</p>
               <p>13. For it is well known, that the <hi>Negro's in
their Native Country,</hi> and perhaps here alſo, if they
durſt ſpeak their inward <hi>Sentiments,</hi> do entertain as
high thoughts of themſelves and of their <hi>Complexion,</hi>
as our <hi>Europeans</hi> do; and at the ſame time holding
the contrary in an equal diſdain, (the like whereof
is affirmed of the <hi>Natives of Japan,</hi> as to their own,
and the Faſhions and Manners of all Strangers, as Mr.
<hi>Bloom</hi> in his <hi>Geography</hi> witneſſeth): Whereby the <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries
of the Roman Church,</hi> (who to facilitate their
Converſion, do condeſcend to humour them in divers
things) are ſaid to repreſent our Bleſſed Saviour in the
<hi>Negro's Complexion;</hi> themſelves alſo deſcribing the <hi>evil
Spirit</hi> in ours. Now if Fancy and Opinion againſt
<hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt carry it, there is no doubt but they will
not ſpare for that, even to vie with the beſt of us;
and then for number, 'tis certain they can out-mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
us. So that without a recourſe to Force, the
Conteſt on our part will be managed upon very <hi>une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
terms,</hi> and in no caſe is like to ſucceed but to our
diſadvantage. And for <hi>Force,</hi> I ſhall in due place
ſhew, how little it can avail in things of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>14. But the determination of this Point will much
depend upon the right underſtanding and knowledg of
<hi>Real Beauty,</hi> a true ſtandard whereof the Nations have
not yet pitcht upon. That being Deformity with
others, which amongſt us is the only <hi>perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56561:19"/>
Figure.</hi> As a certain Author in a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> upon
this Subject, by infinite Collections and Inſtances in
the practice and behaviour of more diſtant Nations,
hath abundantly ſhewn. So that if the other part of
the World ſhould once come to agree upon this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
without conſulting us here (which 'tis poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when ever they go about it, they may omit),
and <hi>like unto us,</hi> maliciouſly determine the Matter in
favour of themſelves, they only may be the <hi>Men,</hi> and
our ſelves but <hi>Beaſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>15. And that no better is like to be the <hi>Iſſue</hi> of ſuch
a Conſult, may be from hence concluded, for that the
largeſt proportion of People, perchance five out of
ſix parts of the World, will upon a due ſurvey, be
found of a more dull and ſable <hi>Complexion</hi> than the
<hi>Europeans.</hi> Of whom, as may be probably conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
many by mingling with other Nations, as <hi>Spain</hi>
with <hi>Moors, Jews</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> are, for the general, ſhort
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> clearneſs. The like may be ſuſpected
of other bordering Regions; and of <hi>Britain</hi> it ſelf, if
we call to mind the Epithets <hi>[Picti &amp; Caerulei]</hi> which
the Poet <hi>Martial, Epiſt. 45. l.</hi> 11. &amp; 99. <hi>l.</hi> 14. beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on its Inhabitants. And even of thoſe Countries
that are more Northerly, the <hi>Natives</hi> Countenances do
differ much from ours. As the ſwarthy <hi>Americans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Hudſon</hi>'s Bay, and of <hi>Canada,</hi> with the adjacent
parts, do teſtifie. And thoſe of our own Nation, or
our Neighbours, who have betaken themſelves to
theſe <hi>hotter Climes,</hi> do in a ſhort time after their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
foot here, diſcover a very diſcernable alteration,
not only from <hi>thoſe at Home,</hi> but from <hi>themſelves</hi> alſo
as to what they were at their firſt arrival. Whoſe
<hi>Off-ſpring,</hi> after the Succeſſion of ſome few Ages, may,
(judging by what is already viſible of many of
them) become quite <hi>Black,</hi> at leaſt very <hi>Duskie</hi> and
<hi>Brown,</hi> like our brindle <hi>Mulatto</hi>'s and <hi>Indians.</hi> The
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56561:19"/>
                  <hi>Perſians</hi> alſo, and <hi>Madagaſcars,</hi> with other Eaſtern
Nations, do carry more ſwarthy Complexions, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the <hi>Colour</hi> of the former, and even blacker
than the <hi>Moors:</hi> That obſervation of the Poet, <hi>Et mauro
obſcurior Indus;</hi> being ſtill no leſs true, than when
'twas firſt made: Now if the like ſhould happen here to
our <hi>Engliſh Off-ſpring,</hi> we ſhould one Day have too much
cauſe to repent of our large Diſcoveries in theſe Parts,
which of <hi>Men,</hi> (by their being Tranſplanted hither)
muſt ſo inevitably make them to degenerate into Brutes.</p>
               <p>16. This Fiction of the Brutality of the <hi>Negro's,</hi>
doth contradict that Maxim in common obſervation
concerning the <hi>Non-generation</hi> of Monſters; for theſe
being no part of the firſt Creation, did not obtain from
God that Bleſſing <hi>of being fruitful and multiplying, and
of repleniſhing the Earth,</hi> Gen. 1. 28. &amp; 8. 17. which
other created Animals then did. According to which
our <hi>Mulatto's</hi> and <hi>Meſtizo's</hi> (the production of <hi>Negro</hi>
or <hi>Indian mixtures,</hi> with other leſs ſwarthy People)
would want this prolifie faculty, and never be able to
<hi>procreate their like;</hi> the contrary whereof is daily ſeen
in this and in the other <hi>Colonies.</hi> The like alſo would
be the condition of the <hi>African Moors,</hi> oppoſite to
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> of whom 'tis ſcarce to be doubted but
that they are a mixt Generation; deſcendents of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro's,</hi>
the firſt Inhabitants, and <hi>Europeans,</hi> from the
oppoſite Shores, by whoſe People they have formerly
been Conquered; Their Hair, Figure, and Complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
(the ſame with our <hi>Mulatto's)</hi> beſpeaking no
leſs. Whereas our remoter <hi>Africans,</hi> into whoſe Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
thoſe Nations never till of late had pierced, and
ſo had no opportunity of the like Mixtures, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
Black, their Hair frizled like Wooll, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thouſands here do witneſs. Now all theſe <hi>Moors,</hi>
muſt, <hi>like the Mules</hi> (from whom the term <hi>Mulatto</hi> is
borrowed) be for ever Barren, admitting the ſaid Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
and Maxim to be alike true.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56561:20"/>
17. Herein doth alſo concur every Man's Senſe and
Judgment touching other Creatures, nothing doubted
(tho <hi>Black)</hi> to be of the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> with the <hi>Whiter:</hi>
As is ſeen of Birds, which do often differ much in
the Feather, yet nevertheleſs are one and the ſame
in kind. But, alas! for this the poor <hi>African</hi> muſt
be Unman'd and Unſoul'd; accounted, and even ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with <hi>Brutes.</hi> A partiality highly becoming Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
pretending to ſo much Juſtice and Knowledg,
which ſome do arrogate to themſelves, and would
even be thought to profeſs, whilſt they practice and
aſſert Principles ſo oppoſite thereunto!</p>
               <p>18. Here alſo it might be demanded, Why <hi>Colours</hi>
ſhould do more than <hi>Deformities,</hi> by all granted not to
prejudice the concerned party as to his <hi>Species?</hi> A
Crooked Perſon, Dwarf, or Hermophrodite, being
as truly of the <hi>Species</hi> of Man, as any the more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
Simple, and well Proportioned. The Canons
of the <hi>Church</hi> formerly (and for ought appears ſtill)
allowing even thoſe laſt, as capable of Benefices with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Diſpenſation, ſaith one, and to be promoted to
<hi>Holy Orders.</hi> And both the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Common Law</hi>
not prohibiting them to be inſtituted Heirs, to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to an Inheritance. And even Monſtrous Births
partaking of Mankind, having the benefit and help of
Reaſon, may very well, ſaith the ſame Perſon, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to ſucceed to their Parents <hi>dying Inteſtate,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the cuſtom of moſt Countries, which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
that the <hi>Dead</hi> ſhould give <hi>Seizin</hi> to the <hi>Living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>19. To this, I ſhall not think it time miſpent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe
a Story, borrowed out of a <hi>French</hi> Author made
<hi>Engliſh;</hi> which happened, as he ſaith, not many years
ſince, near <hi>Argenton,</hi> a Town in <hi>Normandy.</hi> It is this:
<q>A certain Gentleman complotted with ſome Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
there to play certain Plays, wherein ſhould be
acted certain <hi>Devils,</hi> to the intent that the Pleaſure
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56561:20"/>
and Paſtime of their <hi>Pageant</hi> might be greater. And
this Gentleman would needs himſelf be attired in
the habit of a <hi>Devil,</hi> and did perſonate ſuch a part;
Inſomuch, as after the Plays were ended, he chafed
in his Furniture, went home to his <hi>Wife,</hi> and had
company with her clad in the ſame attire wherein
he <hi>played the Devil.</hi> By means whereof, ſhe at the
end of nine Months, was delivered of a <hi>Son</hi> ſo
Monſtrous, as in his Countenance, Head, Face, and
all the parts of his Body, eſpecially in his Feet, he
reſembled and was more like unto a <hi>Satyr,</hi> ſuch as
the Poets have deſcribed, than unto an ordinary and
natural Man. After this he had other Children; all
which, together with their brother the <hi>Monſter,</hi> did
ſurvive both their Parents. Upon whoſe deceaſe
there grew a Contention and Variance between them,
touching the <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of his Inheritance; all of them
endeavouring to exclude this Monſter, not only from
the birth-right of being Heir and Eldeſt Son, but
even from the total <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of any thing that he
ſhould claim, that might in Right appertain unto
him. Hereupon was the Proceſs ſued, and the
Matter proceeded in ſuit between them, before a
Judge of an <hi>Inferiour Court:</hi> By whom it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that they ſhould make their Entry upon the
<hi>Eſtate,</hi> and that the Eldeſt Brother ſhould Inherit,
as next Heir to his Parents, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of <hi>Normandy.</hi> From this Sentence, the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Brethren brought their Appeal, and removed
the Suit into the Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Roan,</hi> where
it was by them pleaded, that he was a very Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
born, and that there was no Reaſon that he
ſhould be accounted a <hi>Man.</hi> But hereunto it was
replied, <hi>That thoſe were not in any ſort to be allowed
Monſters, who are born of Mankind, and are capable of
Reaſon, and of the future Reſurrection.</hi> But thoſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56561:21"/>
only are to be held for ſuch, who are born of ſome
<hi>Beaſt,</hi> and not of a Man; which laſt, as they are
forthwith to be ſlain, ſo the former may not in any
ſort be ſo dealt with, <hi>whether they have the uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or not;</hi> but be ſo Monſtrous as not having ſo
much as the Face of a Man, but rather of ſome
Beaſt. Nor are they ever denied due ſucceſſion in
Inheritance; but the Monſter doth either Bellow
like an Ox, or eat Graſs as a Sheep, <hi>performing only
the actions of a Beaſt.</hi> And therefore the Defendents
concluded, that the Judgment had been <hi>well and
rightly yielded:</hi> And the Court by a ſolemn Arreſt,
did confirm the ſame, and pronounce that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
from which the Brethren had Appealed, <hi>ſhould
be fully and wholly Executed,</hi>
                  </q> &amp;c. Thus far our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
Wherein may be obſerved, that as <hi>Intereſt</hi> indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the younger Brethren to conſpire together to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
the Elder of his Inheritance upon the advantage
of his Deformity, ſo the <hi>Reaſons and Arguments</hi> uſed
in his behalf, together with the <hi>Sentence</hi> thereupon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
do prove as much for our <hi>Negro's,</hi> as for that
ſuppoſed <hi>Monſter.</hi> To this I ſhall add, that in the
Book before mentioned <hi>(Numb.</hi> 14. of this Section)
conſiſting of ſtrange Repreſentations and unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>Features,</hi> both of Face and Body, agreeable to
the Faſhions and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of the ſeveral places they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
unto, but much exceeding the <hi>deformity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion;</hi>
the Author doth not therefore in the leaſt ſeem
to ſuſpect any of them, as if thereby the further remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from <hi>perfect and real Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>20. This opinion alſo, if driven to the head, would
infer another no leſs ſtrange and before unheard of
conceit in Divinity, <hi>viz. That Colours are a means of
Grace,</hi> and have a power in them to <hi>recommend us to
God.</hi> Whence it would follow, that Vertue ſhould be
an unſeparable attendant upon Beauty; and the faireſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56561:21"/>
Bodies muſt then inevitably inſhrine the pureſt and
brighteſt Souls; the contrary whereto was the Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt's
obſervation. The holy Scripture no leſs infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
us the ſame, when it teacheth us, that God looks
not upon <hi>the Countenance, or the height of the Stature, nor
ſeeth as Man ſeeth, but God looks upon the Heart.</hi> And
in truth, this whole Argument is fraught with too
many evil Conſequences and Abſurdities to be relied
on: and therefore deſerves to be thrown aſide, and be
forgotten into a diſuſe, as too dangerous a Weapon
for Slaves to learn the uſe of from us. And which
being turned to the other end, may be ſo improved as
to humble us to the ſame <hi>Brutality,</hi> which we ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
have imputed to our <hi>Negro's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>21. NOR will <hi>Bondage,</hi> which is the next thing to
be treated of, do any more towards this Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and Brutifying of our <hi>Negro's,</hi> than Deformities
could: It being not to be imagined by ſober Men
(whatever the diſtracted Tribe may do) that Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
and evil <hi>Accidents</hi> ſhould carry that force in
them as to alter Subſtances; there being no ſo great
Faſcinations attending the mightieſt changes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
as thereby to take away the nature of things.
For he that before was a Rich Man, or Potentate, is
ſtill a Man, tho like <hi>Belizarius,</hi> become a Beggar.
<hi>Marius</hi> was as much a Man when conceiled in the
Marſh and Dungeon, as when he arrived to be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul</hi>
the Seventh time. And <hi>Caeſar</hi> when in the Pirats
hands, was the ſame Man, as when he got to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<hi>Dictator. David</hi> was but a Man when he was
King of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and ſo he was too, when purſued by
<hi>Saul.</hi> Nor did <hi>Job</hi> become a Beaſt upon his great
Loſſes, any more than he could be ſuppoſed more than
a Man, upon his <hi>Reſtauration.</hi> Now Slavery is but a
lower degree of Poverty and Miſery; but not the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt;
for there are conditions more Calamitous; As to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56561:22"/>
be deprived of all the Comforts of Life by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Confinement and Neceſſity, with a continual
dread and expectation of a miſerable Death. So alſo
to be vexed with loathſome Ulcers, and ſharp tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Diſeaſes, all hopes of Relief and Reſpite being
cut off; are conditions to which Slavery, ſimply and
alone, is to be preferred. Yet none of theſe do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
the Party, tho they may much humble and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe
him. Such evils altering only the <hi>outward ſtate</hi> of
things, but making no impreſſion upon the <hi>inner Man,</hi>
further than as our ſelves ſhall give way thereto;
which froward and impatient Minds can as well do
without it. An adverſe Fortune may deprive us of
our Goods and Liberty, but not of our Souls and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Of which whilſt we are poſſeſſed, and do quietly
enjoy, 'tis neither the Ambition nor Covetouſneſs, much
leſs the Frowns and Menaces of any Imperious or <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannic
Lord,</hi> can bereave us of that <hi>Right</hi> which we
naturally have to be ranked within the Degree and
<hi>Species</hi> of Men.</p>
               <p>22. And to manifeſt this, I will ſuppoſe, what I
would be loth ſhould happen, that ſome one of this
Iſland going for <hi>England,</hi> ſhould chance to be ſnapt
by an <hi>Algerine,</hi> or <hi>Conſaire</hi> of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and there to be
ſet on Shore and Sold; Doth he thereupon become a
Brute? If not, why ſhould an <hi>African,</hi> (ſuppoſe of
that, or any other remote part) ſuffer a greater altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than one of us? This certainly muſt either not be,
or muſt proceed from ſome ſecret power peculiar to
that Soil and Air, where Slaves are gendred and made;
and then what Spell have we againſt ſuch powerful and
ſtrange <hi>Brute-Anthropies?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>23. If Slavery had that force or power ſo as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoul
Men, it muſt needs follow, that every great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
might at his pleaſure, make and unmake Souls;
and a Servant running away, or buying his Freedom,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56561:22"/>
would make himſelf one: As on the contrary, he that
ſuffered <hi>his Ears to be boared at his Maſter's Door-poſt,</hi>
Exod. 21. 6. muſt in that act annihilate and deſtroy
his Soul, his Body nevertheleſs ſurviving. And the
having, or not having of a Soul, would ſignifie but
the bare enjoyment or want of <hi>Liberty;</hi> of which a
<hi>Horſe</hi> is no leſs capable than a <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>24. But that Conqueſt and Subjection can make no
impreſſion upon the Soul, is plain even from this, that
it cannot effect a leſs thing; <hi>not ſubdue the Will,</hi> which
yet is under the command of the Soul, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> power: A Victory being rarely heard
of which makes the <hi>Affections</hi> to yield, and reduceth
the Will of the conquered Party: as the Poet long
ſince ſang;
<q xml:lang="lat">
                     <l>—Victoria nulla eſt,</l>
                     <l>Quam quae confeſſos animo quo<expan>

                  </q>
Now Religion being, according to <hi>Lactantius,</hi> of <hi>all
things moſt Voluntary,</hi> cannot be expelled its hold at
another's pleaſure; nay, it is not under the power of
the <hi>Owner;</hi> for a Man cannot believe, or not believe
whatever he pleaſeth. Now all that can be ſaid to
abate the power of <hi>Conqueſt</hi> over the Will or Mind,
doth conclude more ſtrongly againſt our <hi>Plagiaries,</hi>
who are inveſted with a leſs full and compleat Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over their <hi>Captives</hi> and Slaves, then Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
are.</p>
               <p>25. And here withall it might be conſidered, how
monſtrous and inhumanly cruel they are, who do both
buy and retain in this <hi>Soul-murthering and Brutifying-ſtate
of Bondage,</hi> thoſe whom they might ſo eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
to their priſtine <hi>Homoneity,</hi> and of meer Beaſts,
with one little blaſt of their Mouths, even but a word
or two, convert into Men; and be at the ſame time
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56561:23"/>
the happy <hi>Authors</hi> of life to Souls, as well as freedom
to Bodies. A Privilege too great and glorious for
the reſt of the World to enjoy, and yet <hi>not regarded
here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>26. Again, If Slavery hath ſuch a faculty or power
as to tranſmute Men into Beaſts, or if all <hi>Negro's</hi> be
naturally ſuch, may we not be bold to demand what
will become of thoſe <hi>Debauches,</hi> that ſo frequently do
make uſe of them for their <hi>unnatural</hi> Pleaſures and
Luſts? Or of ſuch of our People, who have Intermarried
with them? Sure they would be loth to be endited of
<hi>Sodomy,</hi> as for lying with a Beaſt. It would be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
convenient for them to renounce that Beaſtly opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
or elſe that the Law may have its free Courſe,
and <hi>be let looſe upon them:</hi> Of which they would have
no cauſe to complain, but of that firſt wicked Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
               <p>27. Laſtly, If a Slave ſetting foot upon the Soil
of ſome Countries, (as of <hi>France)</hi> be thereby at the
very inſtant made a <hi>Freeman;</hi> or elſe, (as in the ſame
Kingdom is alſo cuſtomary) <hi>by receiving Baptiſm:</hi> It
muſt needs follow that theſe ſeveral Actions have the
faculty to tranſubſtantiate Things and Perſons: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by ſetting Slaves at Liberty, they furniſh them
with Souls; and of certain Creatures, of a different
<hi>Species,</hi> (for that will neceſſarily follow, if they were
not ſuch before) <hi>do create them Men.</hi> But if this be
falſe, then being become free, they either muſt ſtill be
<hi>without Souls,</hi> or elſe were indued therewith in their
very Slavery; the latter of which muſt needs be true,
the firſt being not in the leaſt ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>28. And here alſo it may be demanded and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
why Liberty and Freedom ſhould effect more
upon <hi>Men,</hi> than upon other <hi>Creatures;</hi> who according
to this Suppoſition, the <hi>wilder</hi> they are, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the more at <hi>Liberty,</hi> would ſo much the nearer
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56561:23"/>
approach to <hi>Humanity,</hi> and be endued with Souls
too; But (which of all the reſt, is moſt Monſtrous)
with ſuch Souls, as muſt in all things agree with an
<hi>Animal,</hi> or Brutiſh (not a <hi>Rational)</hi> being, the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into Men. And ſo all Subiects and ſubordinate
<hi>Governors</hi> would be Men but in part; but yet by ſo
much the more, by how much they approached nearer
to <hi>Abſoluteneſs.</hi> And in all the <hi>Grand Seignior's</hi> ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Dominions, where there are none but Slaves, there
would not be ſo much as one Man beſides himſelf;
not excepting the very <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of which Belief, the <hi>Authors</hi> thereof may
ſooner feel, than they are willing to underſtand or
ſee.</p>
               <p>29. There were no Men in the World ſo likely as
the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> to have entertained
this baſe eſteem of Slaves; becauſe void of all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
to their Senſuality, and free from thoſe ties
of Conſcience unto which <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is ſubject, had
they had any colour of Reaſon for it; and, being ſuch
from whom are tranſmitted to us the greateſt preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of Severity towards their <hi>Slaves,</hi> as having no
Reſtraints beſides the goodneſs of their Diſpoſition
and <hi>Genius,</hi> which were not always very operative in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of them; yet Reaſon prevailed ſo far with them,
as to confeſs them to be Men, nothing appearing upon
<hi>Record</hi> in contradiction thereto, but very much from
their <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Writers</hi> in the confirmation of it.
Hence that trite Diſtich, aſcribed to <hi>Cato,</hi> adviſeth, <hi>Si
fueris ſervos mercatus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Homines tamen eſſe memento:</hi>
Agreeable to that of the <hi>Greek</hi> Poet <hi>Philemon,</hi> thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing

&amp;c. <hi>That is, That no one is the leſs a Man for Servitude.</hi>
And no leſs doth the good natured Maſter in <hi>Juvenal</hi>
acknowledg, when on his Slaves behalf he delivers
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56561:24"/>
this Oracle, <hi>Nulla unquam de morte hominis cunctatio

a Man's Life (then, as is ſaid, pleading for his Slave)
was concerned. Which the Virago Miſtreſs in her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
durſt not Contradict, <hi>O Demens! Ita Servus
Homo eſt?</hi> Tho ſhe derided her Husbands tenderneſs.
And <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> as I think <hi>Dion</hi> relates of him,
being invited to a Dinner, where he overheard the
outcrys of a certain Slave, condemned to be Impaled
for a miſcarriage about ſome Criſtal Glaſſes, forbad
the Execution, affirming, <hi>That the Life of a Man</hi> (that
is, of that Slave) <hi>was of too great value to be deſtroyed
for Trifles.</hi> And <hi>Tully,</hi> ſpeaking of Juſtice, declares
it due, <hi>Etiam adverſus Infimos,</hi> even to the baſeſt ſort of
Men, which he there affirms Slaves to be. And tho theſe

12. 44. by the firſt, and the others zeal to proſelyte

of them. And even the laſt, the under <hi>the like
temptation of Profit,</hi> yet do not think it worth their
giving the Lye ſo palpably to both their own and
every Man's Reaſon.</p>
               <p>30. THE two laſt things objected, are the <hi>Negro's
Stupidity,</hi> and the pretended <hi>barbarouſneſs</hi> of their
Manners; both which, for brevity, I ſhall diſpatch
together. Their Barbarouſneſs (which I ſhall treat
of firſt) muſt be diſcernable either from their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56561:24"/>
and Converſation in the World, or elſe from
their behaviour and practice in their <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>
of <hi>Religion;</hi> or from both. Now for Religion,
It cannot be denied but that nothing is more barbarous,
and contrary to Chriſtianity, than their <hi>Polygamy,</hi> their
<hi>Idolatrous Dances,</hi> and <hi>Revels;</hi> in which they uſually
ſpend the <hi>Sunday</hi> after that the neceſſity of labour for
their Proviſions (for the Planting of which, that
Day alone is allotted them) has been complied with.
But as to theſe, the blame doth lie wholly upon ſuch,
who pretending themſelves Chriſtians, do ſuffer and
even compel them to thoſe Actions; part whereof
are againſt their Wills, and where even a Check or
Frown, would reſtrain them from the reſt.</p>
               <p>31. And here, that I may not be thought too raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to impute Idolatry to their <hi>Dances,</hi> my Conjecture
is raiſed upon this ground (beſides their being <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles),</hi>
for that they uſe their Dances as a <hi>means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Rain:</hi> Some of them having been known to beg
this Liberty upon the Week Days, in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
Now it is certain, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> anciently
did eſteem and practiſe <hi>Dancing,</hi> as a part of <hi>Divine
Worſhip:</hi> And no leſs alſo did the <hi>Jews;</hi> as may be
proved from <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 19. and from <hi>David's Dancing
before the Ark,</hi> 2 Sam. 6. Add to this their placing
confidence in certain Figures, and ugly Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of none knows what beſides themſelves (which
very decently for want of more <hi>Magnificent Temples,</hi>
they uſually enſhrine in ſome ſtately <hi>Earthen Potſherds;)</hi>
The Fugitives and Runaways believing theſe <hi>Deities</hi>
able to protect them in their Flight, and from Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
(like as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> worſhiping of <hi>Baal Zephon,</hi>
was to detect them): Their companions and fellow
Slaves alſo, that remain'd at Home, having been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
upon the ſeizure of theſe <hi>Puppets,</hi> in a ſearch
after the other, inſtantly to give aſſurance that there
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56561:25"/>
was no poſſibility of their further concealment. And
this doubtleſs is a manifeſt token of their <hi>Impiety</hi> in this
kind, and no leſs of their <hi>Barbarity.</hi> But as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
would ſoon <hi>(if duly applied)</hi> cure this evil;
ſo I ſee not how it ſhould prove them to be Brutes,
more than the reſt of the World, formerly, and even
to this Day, more or leſs, addicted to the ſame vanity
and deception of <hi>falſe Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>32. And then as to their <hi>Civil</hi> Converſation and
outward Demeanour in the World, it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
it ſhould be ſo Gentile and Modiſh as our <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans,</hi>
who perchance muſt be acknowledged as not to
be parallel'd by any other of the three Quarters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
upon whom yet as great Barbarity was formerly
no leſs chargeable; as moſt <hi>Authors</hi> do agree. <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
in the Life of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> tells us that the <hi>Athenians</hi> lived
ſcattering like the wild <hi>Nomader</hi> of <hi>Scythia,</hi> before
they were by him reduced to a better order of Life,
formed into civil Societies, and acquainted with the
bleſſings of Government. And the <hi>Aborigines</hi> are by
<hi>Saluſt,</hi> deſcribed to have been, <hi>Genus hominum agreſte,
ſine legibus, ſine imperio, liberum atque ſolutum,</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
wild People, without Laws, or Government, looſe
and deſtitute of all poſitive Obligations. And <hi>Ceſar's</hi>
account of the Ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> is not ſuch as ſhould
make us proud; For he informs us that they were clad
with Skins, and did paint their Bodies; (from which
cuſtom the name of <hi>Britain</hi> is by our <hi>Cambden</hi> deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved).
He alſo adds, that <hi>Brothers</hi> with Brothers, and
<hi>Parents</hi> with their Children, had Wives in common:
A greater Barbarity than I have at any time heard of
amongſt the <hi>Negro's.</hi> And this we find, of them,
very late, and but a few Years before our <hi>Saviours</hi>
Birth, tho ſituated much nearer to the civilized World,
and withalin a colder Clime, than any part of <hi>Africa,</hi>
and moſt of <hi>America.</hi> And ſo little were they advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56561:25"/>
in Civility by their converſe with a gentiler Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that even two hundred Years after this entrance
of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> we find the forementioned <hi>Epithets</hi> of
<hi>[Picti</hi> and <hi>Cerulei]</hi> continued to them. Nor doth
<hi>Tacitus</hi> give any more honourable account of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
from whom the <hi>Saxons,</hi> our immediate Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
are ſprung. Of whoſe Barbarouſneſs alſo <hi>Gildas</hi>
a <hi>Britain,</hi> with other of our Writers, have delivered
no very creditable Account. The <hi>Danes,</hi> who ſupplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, were full as bad, if not worſe. And the
<hi>Picts</hi> who inhabited the North of <hi>Britain,</hi> had that
Name continued long after the other had loſt it;
for no better Reaſon than that, for which the firſt had
it given them. Neither is it improbable but that the
Gaities and Adornments of Elder Ages, did much
conſiſt in Diſcolouring and Painting themſelves, which
is ſtill practiſed in <hi>America.</hi> Our greater Perſonages
no leſs affecting the like diverſity of Colours in their
Attire; and yet muſt be reputed <hi>(not Barbarous,</hi> but)
<hi>Gentile</hi> for it. The like Cuſtom 'tis poſſible was in uſe

that the <hi>Natives</hi> of that Kingdom, who have

more Barbarous than the <hi>Negro's:</hi> And this in

even the <hi>Negro's</hi> obſervation; by whom this petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Taunt hath contemptuouſly, and in reproach

                  </q> That is, Slaves, ſuch as the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro's</hi>

               </p>
               <p>33. Which Indication of our <hi>Negro's</hi> contempt of

even the Inhabitants of our <hi>Mother Country.</hi> It being
certain, that <hi>Africa</hi> was once famous for both Arts and
Arms; that <hi>Carthage</hi> did rival with <hi>Rome</hi> for the
World's Empire, and had well nigh gotten it, tho
now become an <hi>Aceldama</hi> of Barbariſm; even to the
degree of rendring its Inhabitants ſuſpected for Brutes,
as we here find and ſee. And it is alſo evident, that
all our own People do not exceed theſe either for
<hi>Knowledg,</hi> or <hi>Piety;</hi> nor yet always for <hi>Civility,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
Brutiſhneſs is by ſome proudly objected to them.
And without a proviſion for Schools (of which the

together with a ſtricter Care taken to ſuppreſs
Debauchery (hardly to be outdone (therein) by <hi>Sodom,</hi>

and like that laſting monument of God's Wrath againſt
Impiety, may, without a timely Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,

               <p>35. Nor would I be thought to ſpeak this at Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
For I cannot eaſily forget the <hi>ſupercilious</hi> Checks
and <hi>Frowns</hi> (to ſay no worſe), which I have upon this

prudently, <hi>(I am ſure to the Ruine of my ſmall Intereſt)</hi>
been ſometimes bold to urge to our People, in order
to their Conviction, as to the <hi>neceſſity of this Duty.</hi>
Particularly once, ſoon after my arrival into this new
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56561:27"/>
World, for minding a <hi>Negro</hi> of his <hi>Baptiſmal Vow</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
made in <hi>England,</hi> not doubting it to be grateful
to his Maſter, whom I took for a diſcreet <hi>Perſon:</hi>
Which indeed he was, ſo far as getting of Money,
<hi>quo modo, quaeque injuria,</hi> would amount to; in which
his Wiſdom, I afterward found, did wholly conſiſt.
By others it hath been demanded of me, <hi>What I had
to do with their Servants,</hi> when once affirming them to
be a part of a <hi>Miniſter</hi>'s Care and Charge. Another time
it was told me with no ſmall <hi>Paſſion</hi> and Vehemency,
and that by a <hi>Religious</hi> Perſon (for ſo in all things
elſe ſhe appeared), that I might as well Baptize a
Puppy, as a certain young <hi>Negro,</hi> the Mother whereof
was a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and for ought I know (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
her Complexion) <hi>as dear to God as her ſelf.</hi>
Nor was this Gentlewoman in the leaſt infected with
<hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> but a frequenter of the Church, and very
carefully procuring always for her own, what ſhe thus
denied to her <hi>Negro's</hi> Children. And another of the
<hi>ſame Sex,</hi> upon my baptizing a <hi>Male Negro</hi> of hers, of
about thirty Years old, ſpeaking <hi>Engliſh</hi> plainly, and
earneſtly beſeeching it; cauſed this Meſſage to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to me, That <hi>Baptiſm, I was to underſtand, was
to one of thoſe no more beneficial, than to her black
Bitch.</hi> Others alſo of both <hi>Sexes,</hi> I have heard <hi>Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi>
and inveighing at it, with no little ſpite and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracy;
tho not appearing ſuch, whom I might take
for abſolute <hi>enemies to Religion;</hi> which I fear too many,
in theſe parts, are. And in truth, the hard Words, and
evil Language I have upon this account received (and
do expect will now <hi>again be repeated)</hi> would take up
too much room here to be rehearſed; nor is it very
pleaſant for me to remember, further than to blame that
firſt <hi>horrid Principle,</hi> the natural reſult whereof theſe
Diſcourſes and Practices have moſt certainly been.
<q>There being no doubt but that (to uſe the words
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56561:27"/>
of one of our <hi>Homilies,</hi> in an almoſt parallel caſe)
they take the multitude [of <hi>Negro's,</hi> I ſhall add]
for vile Souls, of whoſe loſs and ſafeguard no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
is to be had; for whom yet Chriſt payed as
dearly, as for the mightieſt Prince, or the wiſeſt and
beſt learned in the Earth. And they that will have
it generally taken for indifferent, that a very few
take no hurt (herein alone the Caſe differs, all
being involved in the ſame Neglect and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)
tho infinit multitudes beſides periſh thereby,
do ſhew that they put little difference between the
Multitude and brute Beaſts, whoſe danger they ſo
little eſteem.</q> And in this belief, I am the ſtronger
confirmed, for that ſome of them are more <hi>indifferent,</hi>
as to the baptizing of their <hi>Mulatto's,</hi> as conceiving
theſe a leſs degree removed from <hi>Men,</hi> whoſe Parents
on the one ſide are <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or of the <hi>Whiter ſort;</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of their <hi>Negro's</hi> bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
do I ſee how thoſe other <hi>Inhumanities,</hi> as their
Emaſculating and Beheading them, their <hi>croping off
their Ears</hi> (which they uſually cauſe the Wretches to
broyl, and then compel to eat them themſelves);
their <hi>Amputations of Legs,</hi> and even Diſſecting them
alive; (this laſt I cannot ſay was ever practiſed, but
has been certainly affirmed by ſome of them, as no leſs
allowable than to a Beaſt, of which they did not in
the leaſt doubt but it was juſtifiable). Add to this
their <hi>ſcant allowance</hi> for Clothes, as well as Diet, and
(which is often the calamity of the <hi>moſt Innocent and
Labourious)</hi> their no leſs working than ſtarving them
to Death; all which could never otherwiſe be ſo glibly
ſwallowed by them, but upon a <hi>perſuaſion</hi> of this, or
of the former worſe Principle. Both without doubt
contrived in Hell, receiving their firſt impreſſions in

the Mercies of God in their bleſſed Redeemer,</hi> and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
void and ineffectual his precious Blood ſhed upon
the <hi>Croſs,</hi> for the ſaving of the World. And thus
much ſhall ſuffice for proof of the <hi>Antecedent</hi> of my
ſecond Propoſition, deduced from my firſt general
<hi>Aſſertion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. III. 1. My <hi>Antecedent</hi> being thus made evident,
I ſhall betake my ſelf to conſider the <hi>Conſequent, viz.</hi>
Of the <hi>Right</hi> which our <hi>Negro's</hi> have, and may juſtly
claim to the exerciſe of <hi>Religion,</hi> upon the truth of
what hath been ſaid touching their being <hi>Men.</hi> A
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56561:29"/>
thing that of it ſelf, one would think ſhould naturally
follow, and be granted even of courſe; did not the
<hi>Adverſaries</hi> thereto hope, tho our <hi>Antecedent</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
yet notwithſtanding this by ſome other
ways, to invalidate this <hi>Right,</hi> and to continue them
Heathens. In <hi>order</hi> whereto, they are not wanting of
a twofold Argument; Firſt, The <hi>Imprecation</hi> of <hi>Noah;</hi>
Secondly, Their forfeiture of this <hi>Right</hi> by Servitude.
Now as before, they imployed the firſt to unman their
<hi>Negro's;</hi> ſo, that failing, here they no leſs generouſly
<hi>wreſt</hi> it to rob them of <hi>Religion</hi> (no leſs than of all
other Rights): An <hi>injury</hi> (as in the end I ſhall ſhew)
far exceeding the former, of making them <hi>Brutes</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
and abſtracted from the latter.</p>
               <p>2. Before I ſhall go about to anſwer which, I ſhall
deſire the Reader to <hi>remark</hi> that what they have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
urged, is only againſt the <hi>Chriſtianizing</hi> of <hi>Negro's,</hi>
with ſuch only of other Nations and Complexions
who are under Bondage: Bearing it in hand (be like)
that the condition of the <hi>Tributary Indians</hi> upon the
Continent, of <hi>Hoſtages of Peace</hi> delivered up to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> upon the <hi>Public Faith,</hi> or of the <hi>Manumiſſed</hi>
and freed Slaves, whether from <hi>Perſia, Madagaſcar,</hi> or
the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> brought hither, (none of
them likely, <hi>eſpecially the laſt,</hi> to have been deſcendants
from <hi>Cham,</hi> any more than our ſelves;) enjoyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them a more happy and bleſſed ſtate, as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Which in truth they cannot affirm even of
ſuch of them, who do live in their <hi>Families</hi> in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Hirelings; nor of their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> whoſe Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
are invironed by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Who yet have
been accountable upon all occaſions for Taxes; even
as the <hi>Hoſtages</hi> before mentioned have been (like
Bondmen and Captives) ſtrictly kept to Labour, by
<hi>thoſe</hi> to whoſe care they were committed for <hi>Education</hi>
and <hi>Security</hi> of the <hi>Peace;</hi> which certainly had been
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56561:29"/>
the moſt effectual way to diſturb it, had their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Friends been <hi>ſtrong</hi> enough. To whoſe <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
and <hi>Diſpoſition,</hi> nothing is more contrary then hard
Labour, nor eſteemed ſo <hi>miſerable</hi> a condition;
which the Parents tears (one whereof was a <hi>Werro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanza,</hi>
that is, a <hi>Toparch,</hi> or <hi>Royetlet</hi> of the place; and
the reſt his principal great Men) ſhed at the view
thereof, did ſufficiently evidence.</p>
               <p>3. And ſo betaking my ſelf to the firſt Objection,
which certainly is their <hi>chief ſtrength;</hi> I ſhall conſider
theſe People as <hi>Negro's,</hi> abſtracted from their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Bondage, and only as <hi>Natives</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> at
leaſt Originally; believed to be Deſcendants from
<hi>Cham,</hi> and under the <hi>Curſe,</hi> as is pretended; which is
all we ſhall ſpeak of in this place; reſerving their
Condition to be diſcourſed of alone, and by it ſelf, in
the enſuing Section.</p>
               <p>4. And here, in the firſt place, I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that this Objection is founded on a <hi>Suppoſition,</hi>
including in it theſe five <hi>Falſhoods,</hi> or (at beſt) <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties.</hi>
1. That the <hi>Negro's</hi> are of <hi>Cham</hi>'s Race.
2. That both <hi>Cham</hi> and his <hi>whole Poſterity</hi> were under
the <hi>Curſe.</hi> 3. That this <hi>Curſe</hi> was in its effects to be
<hi>perpetual,</hi> even to the laſt Generation. 4. That it
extended to their <hi>very Souls,</hi> and was a kind of <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</hi>
5. That this is a ſufficient Ground not only
for <hi>enſlaving</hi> them, but for keeping them from the
exerciſe of <hi>Religion.</hi> Nothing of which laſt can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
from thence be deduced; nor even the former of
<hi>enſlaving</hi> them; unleſs, after the reſt is proved, they
make this appear alſo, that we are the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
whom they were to ſerve; and that the <hi>Curſe</hi>
did confer on us a full and perfect <hi>Right of Dominion</hi>
them.</p>
               <p>5. However, to mak out the firſt, they tell us (or
at leaſt do inſinuate) that <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56561:30"/>
from the <hi>Ark,</hi> did, as it were all upon the ſuddain
(as if afraid of each other), inſtantly retire into the
moſt <hi>diſtant parts</hi> of the World (for ſo <hi>Guinea</hi> is to
Mount <hi>Arrarat);</hi> of whom <hi>Cham</hi> directed his courſe
to <hi>Africa,</hi> his Poſterity the <hi>Negro's</hi> (they are ſure)
there keeping poſſeſſion till this very Day, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the great <hi>alterations</hi> elſewhere.</p>
               <p>6. But to anſwer this: Firſt, It is wholly improbable
that <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sons ſhould make any ſuch ſeparation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being beſcanted of Room, they found it neceſſary
to remove; not, 'tis to be preſumed, ſo far as they
would go, but ſome <hi>convenient diſtance</hi> only, for their
better Accommodation; which doubtleſs they might
find, before they had croſt all <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. But ſecondly, Suppoſing both to have happened,
yet 'tis not likely, <hi>at leaſt</hi> not certain, that his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
have kept poſſeſſion there ever ſince, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Reaſons before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> The Poſſibility
of being removed and driven thence back again by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion</hi>
and <hi>Conqueſt;</hi> by none leſs to be ſuſpected or
queſtioned, than by us here in <hi>America,</hi> to whom it is
evident how little ſecurity againſt ſuch alterations, the
<hi>Remoteneſs</hi> of places have been. So that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Inhabitants of <hi>Africa,</hi> (even that ſuppoſure of
<hi>Cham</hi>'s Race ſeating there being granted) might have
as little Relation to its firſt <hi>Seaters</hi> and <hi>Planters,</hi> as the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> or our ſelves, had to the <hi>Natives</hi> here; the
<hi>Saxons</hi> to the <hi>Britains,</hi> or the old <hi>Romans</hi> to the
<hi>Aborigines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Thirdly, This, as to a great part of it, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>unlikely,</hi> but <hi>plainly falſe.</hi> For in an
Account we meet with in the holy <hi>Scripture</hi> (other
Accounts being hardly to be met with, or relied on)
of three Sons of <hi>Cham</hi> (the fourth being believed to
have been <hi>Childleſs)</hi> we find two of them were
feated in <hi>Aſia;</hi> only <hi>Mizraim,</hi> for the Name, ſhall
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56561:30"/>
be allowed <hi>Egypt;</hi> part whereof, <hi>viz.</hi> on the other
ſide <hi>Nilus,</hi> muſt be in <hi>Aſia</hi> too; that <hi>River</hi> being
the bounds to theſe two ſpacious Quarters of the
World. It being alſo not to be forgotten, that the
<hi>Philiſtines</hi> (living alſo in <hi>Aſia),</hi> were his Off-ſpring:
Nor will this concerning <hi>Mizraim</hi> (for we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the concurrence of the <hi>Name</hi> to prove it)
bring any great comfort to the Cauſe, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
its Remoteneſs from the parts we ſpeak of, and
the many great changes (probably (if known) no
leſs objectable againſt the reſt) theſe <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or
<hi>Mizraimites,</hi> ſince firſt carried Captives by <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>
that is, for above two thouſand Years, have
felt. In ſo much that the true <hi>Egyptians</hi> do ſeem
ſince to have been ſwallowed up, and even loſt in
theſe Conqueſts. And now ſuppoſing the like of the
other parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> from which no <hi>Region</hi> in the
World can boaſt of an Exemption, what certainty or
ground can there be for <hi>Conjectures</hi> of this nature?</p>
               <p>9. But to come nearer to the Matter: Either the
Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> with their Families, kept themſelves
<hi>diſtinct,</hi> each of them united in a body by it ſelf, or
elſe did intermingle and live together, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of ſuch diſtinction of Tribe, or Family. If the
firſt, then 'tis evident that the Family, or Tribe of
<hi>Cham,</hi> following <hi>Nimrod,</hi> its Head, did ſeat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in <hi>Shinar,</hi> and the parts adjacent, unto which
the holy Scripture gives witneſs. But if the ſecond,
then what certainty can there be from whom any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or People is derived, the <hi>Jews</hi> only excepted?
Now it is plainly recorded by <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 10. that
<hi>Nimrod</hi> the Son of <hi>Cuſh, Cham</hi>'s Nephew, <hi>began his
Kingdom at Babel,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Shinar,</hi> (for that
cauſe, <hi>Micah</hi> 5. 6. called <hi>the Land of Nimrod)</hi> and
from thence went and built <hi>Nineveh</hi> in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
from <hi>Africa;</hi> which, if <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſpeaks truth,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56561:31"/>
was left for <hi>Epher, Abraham</hi>'s Nephew by <hi>Keturah,</hi> and
his Children, to be by them poſſeſſed, a long while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and <hi>theſe</hi> no Deſcendents from <hi>Cham,</hi> but from
<hi>Shem,</hi> his Elder Brother.</p>
               <p>10. But leſt theſe Tranſactions of <hi>Nimrod</hi> might
be pretended to have been after he had travelled into
<hi>Africa,</hi> and left a Colony there; (to omit the tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and difficulty of the way) it is ſaid expreſly, that
they journyed thither from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of <hi>Africa,</hi> which is <hi>South</hi> from thence. 'Tis
true indeed, the Scripture ſpeaks of the <hi>Earths being
divided in the days of Peleg,</hi> but determines not what
that <hi>Diviſion</hi> was, whether of its Inhabitants <hi>Minds</hi>
and <hi>Affections,</hi> or that which happened upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of Tongues; or whether it were about this or
that way of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and of <hi>Religion.</hi> Or even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
it to have been no leſs then a parting, or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the ſeveral Territories and Quarters of the World,
yet, unto which of their Lots each Parcel or Province
fell, who had <hi>Africa,</hi> or which went to <hi>America,</hi> we
there meet with no Account, or at beſt but a very
<hi>dark</hi> one. And for that of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> as it labours with
the like uncertainty, ſo it is not for their purpoſe to
<hi>mention,</hi> for the <hi>Reaſons</hi> there given.</p>
               <p>11. And whereas the learned Dr. <hi>Heylen</hi> ſuppoſeth
this Quarter of the World to be Peopled from <hi>Arabia,</hi>
by <hi>Cham</hi>'s Poſterity, croſſing the Red Sea: He ſhould
in the firſt place have ſhewed how ſo great a part of
<hi>that Family</hi> diverted another way, not to be imagined
if the Tribes each of them kept together. And then,
ſecondly, Why this might not be as well done by any
other of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Children, conſidering the <hi>improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
thereof, upon the account of the other Journeys
and Aboads made by <hi>Cham</hi>'s Poſterity. And ſo much
for the firſt Suppoſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:56561:31"/>
12. THEIR ſecond carries a more apparent Falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>viz.</hi> That, that ſevere <hi>Imprecation</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> was
denounced <hi>againſt the whole Family of</hi> Cham; whereas
'tis evident that none beſides <hi>Canaan</hi> his youngeſt Son,
was <hi>mentioned,</hi> and therefore not concerned therein;
it being no leſs than thrice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. expreſly ſaid, that
<hi>Canaan ſhould be their Servant.</hi> And ſo before, <hi>Curſed
be Canaan, a Servant of Servants ſhall he be.</hi> Now
whatſoever may be preſumed of the nearer Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Africa,</hi> (which alſo is diſputable) there is not
the leaſt probability from <hi>holy Scripture</hi> (but certainly
very much to the contrary) that the Remoter are
<hi>Canaan</hi>'s <hi>Off-ſpring,</hi> whatever might be ſuggeſted for
his three Brothers. Now it ought here to be taken
notice of, that in all <hi>ſevere ſentences found in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
we are not to <hi>ſtrain</hi> the words beyond their <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſenſe.</hi> And ſeeing <hi>Canaan</hi> alone was mentioned,
(for which reaſon his Children are, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 12. 11.
<hi>ſtiled the accurſed Seed)</hi> there remains not any likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
for our <hi>Negro's</hi> being concerned therein. For
'twas in <hi>Aſia</hi> that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> dwelt. There <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
ſojourned amongſt them; and there <hi>Joſhua</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
found them. Whom having well near exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated,
he condemned the Survivers to be <hi>hewers of
Wood, and drawers of Water to the Houſe of God,</hi> Joſh.
9. 21. &amp; 23. 27. Which ſentence was afterwards by
<hi>Solomon</hi> confirmed, and more fully executed, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>
2. 17. So that in the whole, this ſuppoſed <hi>Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> doth ſeem to be little more than
a <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> overthrow and reduction,
under the Power of the <hi>Iſraelites, Shem</hi>'s Poſterity,
ſome eight hundred Years after to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed;
but not plainly an abſolute Curſe, or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
thereto. Even as the recording thereof by
<hi>Moſes,</hi> doth ſeem to have been eſpecially done only for
<hi>Iſrael</hi>'s juſtification in <hi>diſpoſſeſſing</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:56561:32"/>
13. But our <hi>Negro's</hi> who are quartered in the Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> may juſtly be concluded as too
far diſtant from <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> to be any way concerned
with theſe <hi>Canaanites;</hi> whoſe <hi>guilt</hi> was no doubt then
<hi>expiated</hi> by their expulſion and loſs of their <hi>Country,</hi>
and of their <hi>Liberty,</hi> together with the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of
ſuch who did abide the brunt of the War, or were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
afterwards.</p>
               <p>14. However, ſuppoſing <hi>Servitude</hi> to be the thing
intended in that <hi>Imprecation,</hi> (or <hi>Prediction,</hi> as I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
believe it) and that our <hi>Negro's,</hi> improbable as
it is, were the very <hi>Parties</hi> concerned therein; yet,
as it toucheth not their <hi>Right to Religion,</hi> (which
I ſhall immediately ſhow, ſo) neither doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
confer any <hi>Right</hi> or Authority over them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any, nor <hi>commiſſion us</hi> to be the Executioners of the
Sentence: Any more then <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s threatning of
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did juſtifie <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s burning it, and
murthering the Inhabitants; for which <hi>he was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a fearful judgment,</hi> Iſa. 10. &amp; Jer. 25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
ſo <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s fore-ſight and prophetic Declaration of
<hi>Eſau</hi>'s fate, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. and the fall of his Poſterity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Brother's power, did confer on the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> no
Right of thus Tyrannizing and Domineering over their
<hi>Elder Brother</hi>'s Off-ſpring; as will appear from <hi>Deut.</hi>
7. 8. compared with the forementioned place in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis.</hi>
Beſides this Sentence upon <hi>Canaan,</hi> being once
ſo <hi>thorowly</hi> executed, there is no reaſon it ſhould now
again be <hi>repeated,</hi> even ſuppoſing that (for which
there is no ground), the <hi>Negro's</hi> are his Iſſue; it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too <hi>unmerciful</hi> to puniſh Men to that extremity
twice, for one and the <hi>ſame</hi> Crime.</p>
               <p>15. THEIR third <hi>Suppoſition</hi> is the continuation of
this Puniſhment, which our People are deſirous to
extend to the laſt Man of that Generation, againſt
whom 'twas firſt denounced; notwithſtanding no
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56561:32"/>
mention is made of any beyond <hi>Canaan</hi>'s Perſon.
Now this, as it is contrary to that ſo equitable a <hi>Rule</hi>
in expounding of Scripture, which I before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd;
ſo it thwarts the <hi>Method</hi> which God Almighty
uſeth in puniſhing <hi>Offenders;</hi> who ſeldom or never
ſtretcheth the <hi>iniquity of the Parents,</hi> beyond <hi>the third
and fourth Generation,</hi> where the <hi>Children</hi> do not add
new Guilt of their own. And thence it is that we
reade, that theſe very <hi>Canaanites</hi> we are ſpeaking of,
notwithſtanding the <hi>Curſe,</hi> whom, of all other, it was
moſt likely to reach, had their puniſhment deferred <hi>till
their own Sins</hi> had more fully deſerved it, as may be
ſeen, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 16. And therefore the unjuſt effuſion of
the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> Blood was, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. revenged upon
<hi>Saul and his bloody Houſe;</hi> tho in truth they were no
other than the <hi>Off-ſpring</hi> of theſe <hi>curſed Canaanites.</hi>
Beſides, God hath been pleaſed ſince to declare, that
<hi>for the future, there ſhould be no more occaſion to uſe that
ſo harſh and ill reliſhing Proverb in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>of the Father's
eating of ſower Grapes, and the Childrens Teeth being ſet
on edge: For that from thenceforth the Son ſhould not
bear the iniquity of the Father, but that every Man ſhould
ſuffer for his own Sins,</hi> Ezek. 4. 20. &amp; 18. 2. And
even in the Curſe of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Houſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. That
<hi>they ſhould die in the flower of their Age, and that there
ſhould not be an Old Man of his Houſe for ever:</hi> Yet
upon their Repentance, and a betaking themſelves to
a ſedulous ſtudy of the <hi>Law,</hi> 'tis ſaid by one, that the
<hi>Curſe</hi> was turn'd into a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> and the line <hi>Maſculine,</hi>
before always dying <hi>young,</hi> lived to an <hi>honourable Age.</hi>
                  <q>For God, ſaith the ſame Perſon, changeth his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
concerning the puniſhment of Men upon their
Repentance.</q> And as <hi>[for ever]</hi> doth in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Idiom, appear many times to intend no more
than ſome <hi>conſiderable</hi> ſpace of time, which yet by God's
<hi>Mercy</hi> may be ſhortned; ſo had that Particle been
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56561:33"/>
here affixed to <hi>Canaan's Curſe,</hi> which it is not; yet
there is no queſtion but (as the Apoſtle teſtifies of the
obſtinate <hi>Jews)</hi> that <hi>they alſo may be grafted in, if they
abide not in unbelief</hi> and impenitence; <hi>for God is able to
graft them in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>16. THEIR fourth <hi>Suppoſure</hi> is borrowed from the
fancied <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>deſign</hi> of this <hi>Curſe;</hi> which ſome
will affirm to be a kind of <hi>Tranſubſtantiating</hi> of them
into Beaſts; others, to ſtrike not only their <hi>Souls</hi> (in
this Life), but to be an irrecoverable devoting them
to Perdition and Miſery <hi>in the Life to come.</hi> Whereas
the <hi>Text</hi> mentions no more but Servitude in the <hi>Curſe;</hi>
not to be exceeded in the <hi>Gloſs,</hi> or Interpretation,
where the words are void of <hi>Ambiguity,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in <hi>ſevere</hi> Caſes. And this Service was alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to his <hi>Brethren,</hi> which cannot be ſuppoſed to
be ſpoken of the <hi>Devils;</hi> it was to touch only their
Bodies; it being not in the leaſt probable, that <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Noah</hi> would curſe the Soul of his Son, which
was <hi>none of his,</hi> had he been ſo uncharitable; but
was derived from a better <hi>Author,</hi> and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his power: God having declared, that <hi>each Soul
is his; the Soul of the Son, as well as of the Father,</hi> Ezek.
18. <hi>And out of whoſe Hands none ſhall be able to pluck
them,</hi> St. John 10. And then as to the other part of
theſe pretended effects; Should we ſuppoſe our <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro's</hi>
to be the very Seed of <hi>Cham,</hi> and that they were
no leſs under the Curſe: Nay further, that the Curſe
had been denounced againſt the whole Poſterity of that
<hi>graceleſs</hi> and <hi>unhappy Son;</hi> yet as we have no aſſurance
of the firſt, ſo neither doth it follow that <hi>Servitude</hi>
ſhould be attended with ſuch <hi>diſmal effects,</hi> as of Men
to transform them into <hi>Brutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. Which objected <hi>Brutality,</hi> had it carried any
appearance, or likelihood of truth, could never poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
have eſcaped the notice of (at leaſt) the wiſer <hi>Jews</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:56561:33"/>
and <hi>Heathen:</hi> who for the general, are found to treat

And that they were a diſtinct People from the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi>
(contrary to what ſome have, I fear, without

That the Scripture <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> (no leſs than this of

between <hi>Egypt</hi> and the <hi>Red</hi> [or <hi>Arabian] Sea,</hi> and
conſequently the ſame with ours. The Scripture doth
in two places of <hi>Ezekiel, viz.</hi> Chap. 29. &amp; 30. (in
both which <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> are repreſented as
Neighbours, but the firſt (agreeable to what was
above mentioned) bearing the more diſtant Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
And alſo in the 68 <hi>Pſalm</hi> (where the ſame
things are obſervable, as in the former) doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely
intimate. And this I have added by way of
prevention, and to defeat a little Argument of our
Adverſaries, moſt impertinently borrowed from the
above mentioned groundleſs Conjecture of ſome one
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56561:34"/>
or two of our Writers, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Scripture <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia</hi>
(and even the Heathen too), was ſituated not
in <hi>Africa,</hi> but in <hi>Arabia;</hi> That ſo nothing there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
might be ſaid to concern our preſent <hi>Negro's,</hi>
nor be alledged in their favour.</p>
               <p>18. Which yet, if certainly true, will not upon
Examination, be found ſo advantagious to them:
The diſtance of <hi>Guinea,</hi> our <hi>Negro's</hi> Country, being
conſidered. For if the Scripture <hi>Ethiopia</hi> be in <hi>Arabia,</hi>
then, for ought appears, <hi>Guinea</hi> (and even the reſt of
<hi>Africa)</hi> is clear of the <hi>Curſe;</hi> ſo that more is loſt by
that Argument, than it ever got. Again, if accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ſignification of <hi>[Cuſh</hi> and <hi>Aethiops,]</hi> they'l
allow its Inhabitants to have been <hi>Black,</hi> (not denied
by any hitherto, and it being no leſs conſonant to
what is before ſaid thereof;) 'twill make as much for
our <hi>purpoſe,</hi> or even more. For thus it is uſually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed;
Becauſe they are <hi>Black,</hi> therefore they are
<hi>Cham</hi>'s Seed; and for this under the <hi>Curſe,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no longer <hi>Men,</hi> but a kind of <hi>Brutes.</hi> But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
hereto, I ſhall thus argue: Either all <hi>Negro's,</hi> or
black People, are of <hi>Cham</hi>'s Race; or ſome are not:
If the laſt, then 'tis evident there will be no neceſſity
for our <hi>Negro's</hi> being under the Curſe; But if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
'twill follow, that notwithſtanding the <hi>Curſe,</hi>
they might, in the general opinion of the World,
ſtill continue to be <hi>Men.</hi> To conclude; I do not in
the whole, ſee that this <hi>Curſe</hi> did touch any more than
the Perſons, Goods, and Poſſeſſions of <hi>Canaan</hi> and his
Poſterity; who ſome eight hundred Years after, were
to fall into the power of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Children: When,
the <hi>Canaanites</hi> being ſubdued by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the
remainder of them condemned to Servitude, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
was accompliſhed to the full.</p>
               <p>19. Their fift and laſt Suppoſition is borrowed from
the <hi>horrible Decree,</hi> (as one calls it) of <hi>Reprobation.</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:56561:35"/>
For tho our People are for the general no great friends
to that <hi>ſevere</hi> Doctrine, as being too frightful for them
to hear of, yet <hi>in this caſe</hi> it muſt ſerve the turn. But
granting it true, that a certain number of Men, and
amongſt the reſt this whole People of <hi>Blacks,</hi> and even
all the reſt of <hi>Cham</hi>'s Race, were thus devoted to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
and become the objects of God's Wrath; yet
will not this juſtifie our barring them of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
and Exerciſe of <hi>Religion.</hi> For they that hold
this Doctrine, do nevertheleſs affirm it our duty, <hi>To
tender the Goſpel unto all;</hi> And that, firſt, becauſe they
are uncertain who they are that are thus <hi>Reprobated,</hi>
(and doubtleſs ours have had no new Revelation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it): And, ſecondly, becauſe their refuſal (of
which our <hi>Negro's</hi> are not guilty, it having never been
<hi>tendered</hi> to them) is to be a principal <hi>Motive</hi> for their
Condemnation. So that nothing in this Doctrine,
taking it altogether (tho we ſhould ſuppoſe it moſt
<hi>Orthodox)</hi> doth prejudice the <hi>Negro's Right;</hi> at leaſt
excuſe our not tendring the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (to omit food and
bodily Neceſſaries) to them, whether in order to their
<hi>Salvation,</hi> or further Damnation.</p>
               <p>20. And thus theſe ridiculous Suppoſures of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

Treatiſe being ſince tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was by the

almoſt as early as the <hi>firſt Notice</hi> of it. Both the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
(amongſt whom St. <hi>Mark</hi> was Biſhop), and the
<hi>Ethiopians,</hi> unto whom St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and other of the

whoſe Zeal and Authority, the work was doubtleſs
much promoted. For otherwiſe it would ſcarce have

                  <hi>Africa</hi> on the Red Sea, which themſelves do affirm,
and ſome places in the Bible before recited (numb. 17
of this Section) do not obſcurely declare. But be they
the ſame or not, 'tis certain thoſe are Chriſtians, whom
we ſpeak of; and have ſo been for a long time; as
(beſides the former <hi>Author) Alvarez</hi> (a <hi>Portugal</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo)
doth in his <hi>Hiſtoria Aethiopica, l. 1. P.</hi> 171. teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.
So alſo the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Atlas Major, P.</hi> 3. 52.
in <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> and <hi>Le-Blanch,</hi> a <hi>Frenchman;</hi> and <hi>Sands,</hi> one
of our own Nation, in his <hi>Journals:</hi> Not to omit the
Teſtimony <hi>Viva voce,</hi> of one of their own Biſhops <hi>Zabo-Zago,</hi>
an Ambaſſadour thence into <hi>Europe.</hi> To which
may be added the Kingdom of <hi>Moni-Congo,</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi>
ſome two Centuries ſince Converted by the <hi>Portugals,</hi>
which our own Hiſtories do mention. And then for
thoſe pieces of <hi>Africa,</hi> that were either part of, or
conterminous upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Seigniory, and
whoſe Shores were waſhed by the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea;
we find in the ſecond and third Centuries, ſeveral
hundreds of <hi>Biſhops</hi> governing the Church there: Of
whoſe number, tho at different ſeaſons, were St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of
<hi>Hippo,</hi> two the moſt Pious, Learned, and Eminent
Fathers of their Times, or ſince. And even the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Nubia,</hi> ſituated in the more inland Parts, were
once Chriſtians; tho now, <hi>through the want of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
degenerated into their former <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> or elſe
<hi>poyſoned</hi> with <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Impoſtures: Which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of ſo ſad a nature, that we ought to make
no further uſe of it, than to curb our own Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to bleſs God that it is not altogether our caſe,
<hi>(tho I muſt confeſs the diſtance from it is not great):</hi> Our
unthankfulneſs having long ſince deſerved ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
total Exciſion. And that as Hereſies have ruin'd
<hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> ſo Faction and <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> being with
us no leſs prevalent, muſt needs in a ſhort time, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56561:37"/>
grow the true Branches in the natural <hi>Tree,</hi> ſo as to
conſume the ſpring of true <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and ſuck out
the juice of right <hi>Religion,</hi> leaving to us the Bark
and Rine only, to be called <hi>Chriſtians. He that ſpared
not them,</hi> will find as little reaſon to pity us.</p>
               <p>24. But to return from this Deviation. If in the
laſt place we look unto the <hi>Gibeonites, the true Poſterity
of Canaan,</hi> and the moſt certain Iſſue of <hi>Cham:</hi> Theſe
(as they are ſuppoſed to have been thoſe <hi>Nethenims,</hi> ſo
often mentioned in <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah)</hi> ſo it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that they pertained to the ſervice of the <hi>Temple:</hi>
Which, had this <hi>Curſe,</hi> or their perſiſting in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> ſtood in the way, could not have been
allowed. And in our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour's</hi> time, one of the
ſame Stock, <hi>a Woman of Canaan,</hi> as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> terms
her; a <hi>Syro-Phoenician,</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> as St. <hi>Mark</hi>
beſpeaks her; both of them, <hi>A dweller upon the Coaſt
of Tyre and Sidon, (now Canaan begat Zidon,</hi> ſaith
<hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 10. 25. and ſo in the 1 of <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 15.
and <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 7. the Territory thereabout is ſaid to
have been the Patrimony of his Children) hath this
<hi>Eulogium</hi> given her from his Divine Mouth, that her
Faith was great; whereby, tho thrice rejected <hi>for a
Dog,</hi> yet ſhe ſtill perſevering, did by her Faith and
Importunity, ſo prevail, as to accompliſh her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.
To theſe I might alſo add, that this was the
Country of the <hi>Widow of Serepta, or Zerepha, a Town
belonging to Zidon,</hi> 1 Kings 17. 9. (and by <hi>Obadiah,</hi> ver.
20. expreſly declared to be <hi>the Canaanites Poſſeſſion;)</hi>
unto which Widow, <hi>Elijah</hi> was ſent; tho there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not Widows in <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the ſame time, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
witneſſeth, to ſuſtain the <hi>Prophet,</hi> or that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have been ſuſtained by him. And thus from the
whole, theſe two things do appear moſt evident; Firſt,
How not only uncertain, but rather, unlikely it is, that
our <hi>Negro's</hi> ſhould be <hi>Canaan</hi>'s Off-ſpring. And, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56561:38"/>
How derogatory it is both to <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
that this Curſe ſhould touch either their Souls or
Bodies, ſo as to deprive them of that <hi>natural Right to
neceſſary relief for both,</hi> which is born with them, and
<hi>can never be ſeparated from them. Religion,</hi> eſpecially
the Chriſtian, making no ſuch <hi>diſtinctions,</hi> which our
Sloth and Avarice have ſuggeſted to moſt of us. And
if the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> did with ſo little patience, hear
his Diſciples urge to him a reſpect for his earthly
<hi>Relations,</hi> ſurely much more muſt he have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed,
had they propoſed to him either <hi>Stature</hi> or
<hi>Countenance,</hi> or any other the like <hi>periſhing Vanities,</hi> to
have become the objects of his Favour. Nor is our
<hi>Negro's blackneſs,</hi> which gives the pretence for theſe
Impieties, (in all probability) occaſioned by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
means, than the <hi>Climate</hi> they live under. The
remoter Inhabitants, within either of the more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>Zones,</hi> (as upon the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> and about
<hi>Fez,</hi> and <hi>Morocco)</hi> being of a brown Complexion,
anſwering to other ſwarthy People, in our <hi>cooler</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.
And whereas 'tis objected that here in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>
under the ſame Degrees, the like Blackneſs is not
found in the Natives; It is to be anſwered, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there the ſame heat, by them to be endured; our
<hi>cooler Breezes</hi> (which <hi>Africa</hi> wants) being here the
conſtant attendants upon the <hi>Sun</hi>'s motion, and with
him for the moſt part gradually <hi>Riſing</hi> and <hi>Falling</hi>
throughout the Year, in all the Regions of <hi>America,</hi>
lying under the <hi>Torrid Zone.</hi> But to determine the
whole matter in a few words: Since this Argument
againſt the <hi>Negro's</hi> is drawn from holy Scripture, (no
other Ancient Author mentioning either the Crime or
Puniſhment, nor for ought we know, ſo much as the
Name of <hi>Cham;)</hi> there is no reaſon why thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who in all other of their Diſcourſes, do <hi>ſcoff</hi> and
flout at it, ſhould be allowed even thoſe juſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56561:38"/>
Advantages derivable from that Scripture, which
they in other caſes ſeem no more to believe, than they
do the Alcoran: And which they mention but with
the ſame reſpect with the ſcriblings of our giddy <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts;</hi>
but with far leſs, than they allow moſt other,
even the <hi>prophaneſt</hi> Authors.</p>
               <p>§. III. 1. And thus having finiſhed the <hi>Firſt,</hi> I
come to the <hi>Second</hi> Objection, by which they hope to
evacuate the <hi>Negro's</hi> Right to Religion: which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be forfeited, <hi>If not by the Curſe, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt by Slavery.</hi> Religion being (forſooth)
a kind of <hi>Spiritual Gentility,</hi> which with them muſt
be loſt or forfeited, by putting on the <hi>Iron Chain</hi> of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.
For certainly no leſs can be collected from
thoſe cuſtomary Replies and Demands, uſually return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon any Advices for the Chriſtianizing of their
<hi>Negro's,</hi> viz. <hi>What, ſuch as they? What, thoſe black
Dogs be made Chriſtians? What, ſhall they be like us?</hi>
With abundance more ſuch like Queſtions. And here
I cannot but obſerve, that as this latter is extendible
to all Slaves, of what Complexion or Nation ſoever,
and no leſs to <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> than to others;
ſo the former doth intrench upon as conſiderable a
number of <hi>Mankind,</hi> even a third part of the World;
and that without all reſpect to their <hi>Condition,</hi> as in
the other; Both Freemen and Slaves being there equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
involved in the <hi>ſame</hi> Calamity, as in this, <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
and <hi>Heathens</hi> are; thereby as it were damming at one
blow, two thirds of the World; all which, or more,
do fall under one of <hi>theſe</hi> Capacities.</p>
               <p>2. And ſo (after taking notice of their <hi>Zeal</hi> in
being thus ready to take the advantage of ſuch
<hi>Forfeitures)</hi> having examined the firſt, I come to the
ſecond Objection: Wherein I cannot but ſee enough
at the very firſt <hi>view,</hi> to move pity and commiſeration
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56561:39"/>
towards theſe People, the <hi>Negro's,</hi> and that even more
than when they were repreſented as <hi>Brutes.</hi> Their
Humanity here ſtanding them in no further ſtead, than
to make them more <hi>Miſerable,</hi> than as Brutes they
could poſſibly have been. For whereas a <hi>Brute</hi> may
according to the Scripture (which is a Book of <hi>Reaſon</hi>
and of <hi>Juſtice</hi> too) in ſome ſenſe have a <hi>Right</hi> to
divers things, the Slave muſt be <hi>deveſted</hi> of all. For
by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, <hi>The Aſs ſinking under his burden,</hi> had
a Right to be relieved by the next Traveller, <hi>Exod.</hi>
23. 5. Nor was the <hi>Ox</hi> to be <hi>muzzled which did tread
out the Corn,</hi> Deut. 25. 4. his labour meriting better
Uſage. And one of the Reaſons for the Sabbath reſt
was, <hi>Exod. 23. 14. That the Ox and Aſs might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
from Toil, as well as their Owners.</hi> (We ſee here,
no working them to death was allowed.) And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
in effect pronounceth that Perſon <hi>unjuſt, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
not the life of his Beaſt,</hi> Prov. 12. 10. So that
here is a plain Right belonging unto Brutes, whilſt
by us it is denied unto Men, <hi>whoſe Fleſh is as our own:</hi>
A thing greatly deſerving <hi>to be laid to Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. For in truth the very Heathen were never ſo
void of <hi>Bowels</hi> and tenderneſs to their Slaves, as to
deny them a <hi>due Right</hi> to neceſſaries for their Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
To which purpoſe it is, that we hear <hi>Cicero</hi>
thus pleading in their behalf, <hi>Off. l. 1. Meminerimus
autem etiam adverſus infimos juſtitiam eſſe ſervandam. Eſt
autem infima conditio &amp; fortuna ſervorum; quibus non

                     </hi> doth plainly ſhew; beſides, that I find this place ſo rendred in a Tranſlation made many Years ſince.</note>

Writers, like <hi>envious</hi> People, deſtitute of <hi>Slaves</hi>
themſelves, were more partial in their Rules to others;
few or none in thoſe times being <hi>without ſome,</hi> whilſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56561:40"/>
divers poſſeſſed <hi>many. Plutarch</hi> writes of <hi>Lucullus,</hi>
that he had forty thouſand; and that by their labour
he levelled fifteen Mountains. And the trouble to
which the <hi>Romans</hi> were often put to ſuppreſs their <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi>
Inſurrections, (whereby it may be ſeen, that
<hi>Slaves may rebel without Religion,</hi> and <hi>that Chriſtianity
is not wholly in the fault, if any ſuch thing ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen)</hi>
doth ſhew that that <hi>free People</hi> were no ſtrangers
to ſuch <hi>Domeſtic</hi> Utenſils, nor to the Profit accruing
by them to their Owners. Nor could <hi>Cicero</hi> eaſily have
amaſſed together ſo great Wealth, to the which, he
was never born, without the labour of <hi>Slaves:</hi> 'Tis
certain, he retained ſome in his Family, which, his ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

it to be imagined, that he then parted with all he had.
But the words <hi>[Libertus &amp; libertinus,]</hi> ſignifying a
<hi>freed Man,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> of ſuch a Perſon, and made
to diſtinguiſh <hi>[liber &amp; ingenuus]</hi> from one that was

their <hi>Right,</hi> and condemn all their <hi>unmerciful</hi> uſage of
them.</p>
               <p>7. But to proceed: Had Slaves no <hi>Right</hi> at all, all
<hi>Laws</hi> and Injunctions againſt <hi>oppreſſing</hi> them had been
unjuſt, 'tis certain very needleſs; for it had been no
other than to infringe their <hi>Owners Right</hi> of exerciſing
his, it matters not whether Gentle or Cruel, Pleaſure
and Authority over them: which might be juſtly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed
even to the utmoſt extremity, were the Parties
diveſted of all <hi>Right</hi> to better uſage. Oppreſſion being
neither more nor leſs than an <hi>over rigorous treating of

pretend, or the other ought to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to; which in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56561:41"/>
this caſe could never happen. For what can he lay
claim to, who hath nothing either <hi>within</hi> or <hi>without</hi>
him, which he can call his <hi>own?</hi> Or what wrong is
it to bar or deprive him of <hi>that which is not his?</hi> Thoſe
Laws therefore do confeſs a <hi>Right</hi> in the Party, on
whoſe behalf they were made. Elſe that in <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.
27. <hi>He ſhall let his Servant go free for his Tooths ſake,</hi>
had been impertinent and injurious. And <hi>Job</hi>'s pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of himſelf, <hi>Job 31. 13. If I deſpiſed the cauſe
of my Man-ſervant, or of my Maid-ſervant, when they
contended with me,</hi> &amp;c. had been idle and ridiculous,
and an argument that he underſtood not his own Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
and <hi>Right,</hi> whilſt he ſtood ſo nicely upon theirs.
And no better had been the advice of <hi>Siracides,</hi>
Eccluſ. 7. 20, 21. &amp; 33. 30, 31. ver. <hi>Whereas thy Servant
worketh truly, entreat him not evilly; nor the Hireling</hi>
(where note what the former were) <hi>that beſtoweth
himſelf wholly for thee. Let thy Soul love a good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and defraud him not of Liberty.</hi> Again, <hi>If thou
haſt a Servant, let him be unto thee as thy ſelf, becauſe thou
haſt bought him with a Price:</hi> So that the <hi>Servant</hi> here
alſo is a purchaſed Bondman; whom yet we are to

The like alſo muſt St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Exhortation (or

[<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>allow</hi> (not give) <hi>your Servants</hi>
(for that agrees not ſo well with what follows) <hi>that
which is juſt and equal;</hi> ſuch things being not to be
reckoned Gifts, which are our <hi>due,</hi> and to which we
have a <hi>juſt Right.</hi> So likewiſe to his <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Chap.
6. 9. <hi>Where he exhorts both Maſters and Servants to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
Duties;</hi> giving the former to underſtand, <hi>That
the Maſter of them both</hi> (ſo the Margent tells us ſome
Copies have it) <hi>was in Heaven; who</hi> (in puniſhing
Injuſtice in either Party) <hi>would be Impartial.</hi> Which,
with many the like places, are to be underſtood of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56561:41"/>
                  <hi>Slaves purely ſo taken,</hi> as may be proved from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.
21, 22. and from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1. Alſo from 1 St. <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 18. in the firſt of which, (omitting that out of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racides,)</hi>
they are adviſed to accept of <hi>Freedom when
offered,</hi> being therefore at that time, no doubt, under
Bondage; as in the next <hi>v.</hi> they are plainly declared to
<hi>be under the Yoke.</hi> Not to be underſtood of thoſe whom
we ſtile <hi>Apprentices</hi> (that is <hi>Learners)</hi> ſuch being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Freedom, ſo ſoon as it is convenient, or ſafe
for them. And therefore we have reaſon to imagine
that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice was given to Servants of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
degree, and to whom Liberty might be more
<hi>ſafe</hi> and advantagious, even as it was more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to be obtained. Beſides, he there chargeth every
Man in general, <hi>to abide in the ſame Calling, wherein they
were called,</hi> that is, wherein Chriſtianity found them;
unleſs (which is preſently excepted) they might <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
obtain their Liberty.</hi> And the cruel uſage unto
which, St. <hi>Peter</hi> intimates the Servants he wrote to
were ſubject, doth ſufficiently manifeſt, that their
Condition was no better than direct Servitude, and
that even to <hi>Heathen</hi> Maſters. For otherwiſe the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
in his 1 <hi>Ep. Ch.</hi> 2. 18, 19, 20. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
had been improper; ſuch Rigour and Cruelty
of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Maſters in thoſe early and devout times,
being unlikely to have eſcaped his <hi>Apoſtolic</hi> Cenſures
and ſevereſt Menaces, if not to have coſt the Authors
a total rejection from the <hi>Communion</hi> of Chriſtians.
From hence alſo we may note, (no leſs than from Saint
<hi>Paul</hi>'s words, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 2. As many as have believing
Maſters)</hi> (which ſhews that ſome of them had not);
that the very <hi>Gentiles</hi> then, were not ſo ill-natur'd
and malicious againſt Chriſtianity, as to hinder their
Slaves from <hi>embracing it.</hi> And throughout the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
both <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servants, and the reſt down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
were no better than Slaves; unleſs where we
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56561:42"/>
find <hi>[Mercenarii, Hirelings,]</hi> for diſtinction, added.
The word <hi>[Slave]</hi> being no where found in the holy
Scripture, except once by a miſinterpretation in the
<hi>Apocalyps.</hi> And the Latine word <hi>[Servus]</hi> taking
its derivation from <hi>[Servatus],</hi> and importing one
ſaved in Battel, by his mercy that took him: In
lieu whereof, by Cuſtom, Gratitude and Neceſſity,
he was obliged to do him Service the remainder of
his Life. So alſo in the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> (beſides that of
<hi>Ecclus.) Raguel</hi>'s giving half his S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rvants to his Son
in Law <hi>Tobias, Tob.</hi> 10. 10. And <hi>Judith</hi>'s ſetting her
Maid free, <hi>Judith</hi> 16. 23. And in the New Teſtament,
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Antitheſis, 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 19. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4. with
the <hi>Jews</hi> reply to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> 8. 23. (all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned) do plainly diſcover the meaning of
the word Servant in holy Scripture, not to import a
Mercenary, or Hireling, but a meer Bondman, or
Slave. And ſo from the whole may be collected,
That Servitude is no ſuch forfeiture of <hi>Right,</hi> but
that a Slave hath as good a plea and juſt claim to Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
both <hi>for his Soul and Body,</hi> as his Maſter hath
to his ſtrength and <hi>induſtry</hi> in thoſe Works, about which
he is imployed.</p>
               <p>8. No more doth that <hi>Maxim</hi> in the <hi>Civil Law, That
whatſoever the Servant acquires, is properly derivable to
his Lord and Maſter, as the true and ſole Proprietor of his
Servants Acquiſitions,</hi> interfere, or jar with this Right,
than any thing that hath been pretended beſides: This
<hi>Right</hi> extending only to neceſſaries for Life, not to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities
or abundance, which are the things aimed at
in that <hi>Maxim.</hi> Theſe only, and not the other being to be
reckoned for Acquiſitions, and therefore ſeizable to the
Maſter. Not but that there are ſome that can ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
this <hi>Maxim</hi> in its fulleſt <hi>Latitude,</hi> and even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to the Lives and Fortues of <hi>Freemen,</hi> whom (no
leſs than <hi>Slaves)</hi> they can without ſcruple diveſt of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56561:42"/>
all <hi>Right.</hi> Theſe ſhall aſſure us, <hi>That Men have no
ſtronger obligations to Juſtice, than either Fiſh, or wild
Beaſts, who prey upon, and devour each other.</hi> And,
<hi>That God is no more honoured by A. N. G. E. L.</hi> (wittily
pronouncing the Letters thus ſeverally, with a ſhort
pauſe between each) <hi>than by B. E. A. S. T.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that ſuch tenderneſs and regard of Equity, is to
be avoided as a great impediment to <hi>Profit; The only
art or ſcience to be ſtudied, and applied by Mankind.</hi> And
no wonder that they who hold and practice ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
concerning <hi>Freemen,</hi> ſhould prove no leſs fierce
ſticklers againſt <hi>the Right of Slaves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. But ſuppoſing that according to this <hi>Maxim,</hi> the
Slave might <hi>without ſpot of Injuſtice,</hi> be by his Owner
deprived of all <hi>Right</hi> to Temporal Priviledges and
Proviſions, yet can it never be admitted as to <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi>
nor be extended to thoſe Proviſions which do
concern the health and happineſs of their <hi>Souls,</hi> that
is, <hi>Religion.</hi> But muſt be underſtood, and only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to the <hi>Goods</hi> of this World: the Poſſeſſion and
Enjoyment whereof may be ſome prejudice, or abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to others, that want them: which I am to ſhew,
can never happen in <hi>Religion;</hi> and this I ſhall prove
three ways.</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the conſideration of the Nature of
<hi>Religion,</hi> which being the Reſult only of a <hi>virtuous
Mind,</hi> and an <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Intellect,</hi> a thing purely <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> cannot be ſubject to the like
inconveniencies with Bodies, compoſed and made up
of Matter. Nor is it to be <hi>engroſſed,</hi> or made over;
but, as <hi>Free-common,</hi> is the true <hi>Right</hi> and Property
of every Man. So that whilſt other Goods may, and
for the moſt part are, poſſeſſed by a <hi>few;</hi> and ſome
do want, whilſt others do enjoy abundance; <hi>The goods
of the Mind are ſufficient for all;</hi> becauſe not limited,
nor circumſcribed; nor, as the other, falling within
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56561:43"/>
the Meaſures and Rules of quantity, whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Infinit.</hi> And no Mans Acquiſitions of this kind,
are any <hi>Diminution</hi> to his <hi>Neighbour.</hi> Whence it comes
that there can be no clamour nor outcry of Wrong or
Injuſtice; and no Man can pretend this Enjoyment
to be any leſſening to himſelf by anothers ſharing with
him. And a Man may as well complain of his being
robbed of the <hi>Light,</hi> or <hi>Air,</hi> becauſe his Neighbour
refuſeth to cloſe his Eyes, or to retain his Breath; as
any Maſter can be ſuppoſed to feel an abatement of his
either Subſtance, or <hi>Religion,</hi> by his Slaves joyning
with him in the ſame <hi>Divine</hi> Exerciſe. <hi>Religion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the true <hi>proprium in Commune,</hi> where every Soul is
at full <hi>Liberty</hi> (without any fear or danger of endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maging
the reſidue of Mankind), to aſſume as much,
and as great a <hi>proportion</hi> thereof, as is needful for him,
and as he can deſire.</p>
               <p>11. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This may be proved from the object
of <hi>Religion, GOD;</hi> unto whom it wholly belongs,
and whoſe entire Property it is, as being the Creatures
Tribute due unto him the <hi>Creator.</hi> Now certainly,
<hi>God</hi> is not the leſs receptive of the Maſter's Devotion,
for his being accompanied therein by his <hi>Slave,</hi> any
more (yea, rather much leſs) than the <hi>North Pole</hi>
can become leſs inſtrumental to the Mariners ſafety,
and preſervation through the multitude of <hi>Points,</hi> at
one and the ſame inſtant, directed to it. And there
is ſpace enough in his <hi>Immenſneſs</hi> and <hi>Infinity,</hi> for our
ſafe repoſing, and his no leſs <hi>ſure</hi> acceptance of the moſt
unlimited <hi>affections</hi> and praiſes of innumerable <hi>Souls,</hi>
conſpiring therein at one and the ſame time.</p>
               <p>12. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This may be proved from the <hi>ſubject</hi>
of <hi>Religion,</hi> the Soul of Man, which is only in <hi>God</hi>'s
diſpoſal, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 4. And therefore cannot become
the purchaſe of <hi>any</hi> Mortal, tho the Caſe, or Body
may; but is entirely poſſeſſed by the Party, or Owner,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56561:43"/>
notwithſtanding his being reduced under Bondage.
<hi>There is no Man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 8.) <hi>that hath
power over the ſpirit, to reſtrain the ſpirit:</hi> But the Soul
can ſtill exerciſe all her powers and faculties, tho in
Chains, and in a Dungeon, or even like <hi>Jonas</hi> in the
Belly of the Whale. <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is,
there is Liberty,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. Even
in the midſt of Bondage our Thoughts are free, and
a Man may think, and wiſh, and pray, in deſpite of
his worſt Enemies: And as our Bleſſed Lord
adviſeth, we may <hi>poſſeſs our Souls</hi> under the hardeſt
Preſſures and Sufferings. From which Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it will appear that the <hi>Soul</hi> of the Slave is no
part of the <hi>Maſter</hi>'s purchaſe, nor can he by any means
make it <hi>ſubject.</hi> And therefore he hath no wrong done
him (tho we ſhould grant the aforeſaid <hi>Maxim,</hi> to
ſtrike at the whole Temporal <hi>Rights</hi> and Enjoyments
(which are but few) that a Bondman can pretend to)
by his Slaves practice and exerciſe of Religion.</p>
               <p>§ V. 1. Theſe Objections being <hi>waſht</hi> off, I come
now poſitively to declare in the Affirmative, that a
<hi>Slave</hi> both may be, and naturally is inveſted with a
<hi>Right to the Exerciſe and Benefits accruing to the ſoul by
Religion;</hi> and that upon a threefold account, <hi>viz.</hi>
Of <hi>Creation, Divine Precept,</hi> and of the <hi>good and evil
of Eternity;</hi> to which laſt, the Slave is no leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and accordingly hath <hi>equal hopes</hi> with his Maſter
to the other. Nor can any Maſter pretend to it upon
other Reaſons than theſe that are here laid down.</p>
               <p>2. Now for the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz. Creation;</hi> this
the Bondman hath in common with his Lord. That
is, he is alike the Off-ſpring of Humane Seed; was
alike ſuſtained in his Mother's Womb; was born, and
drew in the <hi>common</hi> Air, even as others do: <hi>Nor is there
any King that had other beginning or birth,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56561:44"/>
Man. The like alſo is acknowledged by <hi>Job, Did
not he that made him in the Womb make me, and did not
one faſhion us both in the Womb?</hi> Job 31. 15. And as
<hi>all Men have but one entrance into Life, ſo they have the
like going forth of it,</hi> ſaith the ſame Wiſe Man, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 7.
And as the Slave was created <hi>free,</hi> ſo Death ſets him
at Liberty, and reſtores him to the like <hi>freedom</hi> again.
In the Grave both the ſmall and great reſt quietly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
For <hi>there the Wicked ceaſe from troubling, the
Priſoners hear not the voice of the Oppreſſor;</hi> and even <hi>the
Servant is free from his Maſter,</hi> Job 3. Now <hi>Creation,</hi>
from which <hi>Job</hi> infers a Right due unto Slaves, is a
tie of the ſtricteſt Nature, and ſtrongeſt Obligation
of all other; becauſe unto it we are indebted for
whatſoever we either have, or can pretend to. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
and Purchaſe (which do confer on the Lord his
whole pretence of Right or Power over his Slave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
being not poſſible to have been, had not this preceded.
And even our Parents <hi>Right</hi> of Dominion over us, is
infinitely ſhort of this; who in all that they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
towards our being, were but <hi>Agents</hi> ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
unto him, without whoſe Bleſſing no perfection
could have followed. So that whatſoever we enjoy,
primarily is from <hi>God, our true Father,</hi> and Creator.
They being but Procreators, or Deputies unto this
great Author of Life, and all things. Now this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>equally true,</hi> both of Slave and Lord; and God
<hi>Almighty</hi> having this original <hi>Right</hi> and property in
every Man, which ſoveraign <hi>Right</hi> of his cannot by
any after act of his Creatures be forfeited, ſo as to
cauſe an <hi>Alienation</hi> thereof from him (for be the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
where it will, his firſt <hi>Right</hi> can ſuffer no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice):
The Slaves Obligation and Right (I ſo call
it, <hi>it being a real Priviledg) to ſerve God,</hi> continues
firm and inviolable, and no leſs unalterable than his
Lords. Nor can it be ſwallowed up, or loſt in any
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56561:44"/>
                  <hi>new</hi> pretended claim, whilſt that firſt Obligation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
the ſame, which originally it was. No pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of time being of force againſt ſo <hi>ſoveraign</hi> a
Power as that of Gods.</p>
               <p>3. But ſecondly, Slaves have a <hi>Right to ſerve God,</hi>
by virtue of his determinate Precept and Command
for their ſo doing: None of his <hi>Laws</hi> being limited
to any certain <hi>Order,</hi> or <hi>Degree</hi> of Men; but were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to every Man alike, <hi>whether Bond, or Free.</hi> For
he that ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Swear, Kill, Steal, Lye,
Covet, nor commit Adultery,</hi> made no difference nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
in the direction of theſe Laws, either of
<hi>Lords</hi> or <hi>Peaſants, Free</hi> or <hi>Bondmen.</hi> But the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being equally laid on all, muſt exact an equal tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of Duty, from all. No <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> any where
appearing for the omiſſion of the <hi>Duties,</hi> either of <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
or <hi>Religion</hi> to Potentates, any more than the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
or meanneſs of an <hi>inferiour</hi> Perſon, was ever in
holy Scripture admitted as a tolerable excuſe upon
the like occaſion. And this Impartiality, is more
eſpecially the <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Ornament</hi> of Chriſtianity:
which for that Reaſon is ſtiled the <hi>Common Faith,</hi> and
the <hi>Common Salvation;</hi> St. <hi>Jude</hi> 3. and St. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.
Which as the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> preached, St. <hi>Luke 3. All fleſh
ſhould ſee;</hi> that is, enjoy and partake of, if they had
any liking thereto. And in purſuance hereof S. <hi>Paul</hi>
at <hi>Athens,</hi> declareth, <hi>That God had now commanded all
Men every where to repent:</hi> (words comprehenſive and
large; and, methinks very appoſitely pointing to theſe
ſo <hi>late</hi> diſcovered Regions: But to go on). For that
as he writes to <hi>Titus, The Grace of God which bringeth
Salvation, hath appeared to all Men:</hi> Such an Univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
making it an Act of Grace indeed. And the ſame
Apoſtle in his Preaching, warns all alike of <hi>the Wrath
of God, revealed againſt all</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Injuſtice of Men.</hi> Both he and the reſt in their
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56561:45"/>
practice, proving their Senſe to be as <hi>unlimited</hi> and
unreſtrained, as their words were general; ſhewing
themſelves in their <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> no leſs exact and punctual
in ſetting <hi>forth the Duty of Servants,</hi> and <hi>as careful for
the ſaving of their ſouls,</hi> as for their Maſters. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
never ſo beſet with Buſineſs, (tho doubtleſs they
had enough, as having the good of, not one ſingle
Dioceſs or Pariſh, but of the Univerſal, or Catholic
Church, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. in their thoughts and care:)
ſo as to neglect the Soul of the meaneſt Bond-ſlave.
Whom for their encouragement, he aſſures, that <hi>God
himſelf</hi> did take eſpecial cognizance <hi>of their faithful
ſervices done unto Men;</hi> who would not fail to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<hi>whatſoever good thing any Man doth, whether he
be, Bond or Free,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 8. And 'tis remarkable,
that the preceding words to St. <hi>Titus,</hi> do in place im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſucceed an Exhortation to Servants, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
as it were pointing out the very Perſons to whom
that Grace had been manifeſted, <hi>no leſs than to the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
of Mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. And to this agreeth the neceſſity thereof: For
<hi>Vertue,</hi> which is made moſt effectual and operative by
Religion, is alike requiſite and commendable in all
Men: At leaſt if there be any difference, the <hi>Credit</hi>
of it will redound moſt to them, from it was <hi>leaſt</hi>
expected; that is, from Servants. But it is manifeſt,
how neceſſary <hi>Vertue</hi> is, in that all Men do abhor to
be unjuſtly dealt with. And they that regard not
<hi>Vertue</hi> themſelves, do yet expect it in their Vaſſals.
Whence ſome are ſo apt to applaud Integrity, and
other good Qualities in their <hi>Negro's,</hi> and to blame
and puniſh the contrary. Nor can it be doubted but
that good Qualities are as <hi>requiſite</hi> in a Servant, as
<hi>Conjugal</hi> loyalty is in a Married Perſon, or <hi>obedience</hi>
in a Child. Now <hi>Religion</hi> is the ſtrongeſt exciter and
ſpur to theſe <hi>Vertues, fixing</hi> and <hi>engraving</hi> them upon
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56561:45"/>
the Heart of Man, and making ſuch deep impreſſions
thereof upon the Soul, that the Party ſhall even <hi>prefer
Death to the foregoing of his Duty;</hi> which heretofore
hath been evidenced by innumerable Inſtances; ſome
examples thereof have in this Age been produced.
And then can any Man believe other, than that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
is neceſſary for People of <hi>this,</hi> or of <hi>any other</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
whatſoever? Or that it is not the Maſter's great
<hi>Intereſt</hi> to have his Servants minds poſſeſſed, with
principles of <hi>true Piety?</hi> The benefit whereof <hi>is leaſt
to the Slave,</hi> tho he gain <hi>Heaven</hi> thereby; whilſt his
Maſter (beſides that, of which he is no leſs aſſured,
by being inſtrumental thereto) doth in this World
alſo reap <hi>the deſired fruit of his Servant's FIDELITY:</hi>
Which whoſoever hinders, muſt therein be an <hi>enemy</hi>
to that his own great Intereſt. In a word, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſworn, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 23. (again repeated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.
11.) <hi>That every Knee ſhould how to him, and every
Tongue give him thanks, and glorifie him;</hi> (unto which
Service he hath furniſhed Slaves with Abilities and
Parts ſuitable;) and having withal by his expreſs
Commands, impoſed on them alike neceſſity thereof,
(unto which doubtleſs they are obliged to conform,
every Man being bound to be as <hi>Good</hi> and Vertuous,
as <hi>God</hi> doth require of him: I ſay, theſe Reaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,)
the prohibiting and diſabling them for this
Service, is certainly a moſt palpable deprivation of
their Right, which is the worſt I ſhall ſay of it here,
and at this time.</p>
               <p>5. But then in the third place, this Right I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, is no leſs evident from the <hi>good and evil of
Eternity;</hi> which the Maſter and Slave are, according to
their Merits, each of them to enjoy, or ſuffer alike.
For as the Precepts are general, ſo alſo are the Threats
and Promiſes. As for inſtance: <hi>He,</hi> ſaith our Bleſſed
Lord, <hi>that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56561:46"/>
he that believeth not, ſhall be damned,</hi> St. Mat. 16. And
the great Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> indefinitly pronounceth <hi>Sin</hi>
to be the <hi>Wages of Death</hi> to all alike, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. And in
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. he denounceth <hi>tribulation and anguiſh to
every ſoul of Man that doth evil.</hi> So alſo the Prophet,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 10. 20. reſolveth the matter, that <hi>the ſoul that
ſinneth, it ſhall die.</hi> But on the contrary, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
on the Son of Man, hath eternal Life, and ſhall
not come into Condemnation,</hi> ſaith St. John 15. 24. And
ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Whatſoever good thing any Man doth,</hi>
(ſpeaking of Servants) <hi>the ſame ſhall he receive of the
Lord, whether he be Bond or Free,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 8. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
adding, <hi>For with God there is no reſpect of Perſons.</hi>
Now the Slave's Soul being as precious, and his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and hopes equal with his Maſter's, a Right to the
due and neceſſary means, either to prevent the one,
or to obtain the other, cannot be denied him: Unleſs
we will ſuppoſe, <hi>That God ſhould Damn ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Men, for the abominable Lucre of a few greedy
Epicures</hi> and <hi>Mammoniſts.</hi> It being not to be denied,
but that it is a thing highly unreaſonable to tie any
Man to an end, and at the ſame inſtance to bar him
of the means requiſite thereto; and withal, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him to a perpetual Death, for omitting thoſe
<hi>Duties</hi> (if at leaſt we may ſo term them), when he
had no Right nor Liberty to perform them. Wherefore
ſince that the <hi>Ways of God are all equal,</hi> 'tis to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that whatſoever <hi>Penalties</hi> he hath decreed for
the breach of his Laws, muſt be becauſe there firſt was
a <hi>Liberty,</hi> at leaſt, if not an <hi>Ability,</hi> given for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
of them; with ſufficient means allowed both
to obtain the <hi>good,</hi> and to avoid the <hi>evil,</hi> conſequent to
the <hi>keeping</hi> or <hi>neglect</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>6. I ſhall conclude my whole Propoſition with a few
Lines, to this purpoſe, borrowed from a <hi>Sermon</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
on a <hi>Chriſtmas-Day</hi> in this <hi>Iſland;</hi> For which I
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56561:46"/>
am ſure the Preacher (who, tho his Diſcourſe was
to <hi>White People,</hi> did yet deſign it for the benefit <hi>of the
Blacks and Tawneys,</hi> of which our fierce <hi>Quakers</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
(ſee <hi>P.</hi> 4.) was quite Ignorant;) will not be
diſpleaſed. The Text being taken out of St. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.
the latter part of the 10th <hi>ver.</hi> his Diſcourſe thereupon
was to this effect. <q>And that we may not too proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſult upon theſe People [the <hi>Negro's,]</hi> and with
the <hi>Poet,</hi> reſolve againſt them,—<hi>Quod nulla ſub illa
cura Jovis Terra eſt:—That they are wholly without
the care of Heaven, and of God's Protection and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi>
That like the <hi>Mountains of Gilboa,</hi> no Dews
nor Showres of Grace were to fall upon thoſe parched
Fields; or like the <hi>barren Fig-tree,</hi> they were ſmitten
with a perpetual Curſe; we find them admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Church</hi> upon the firſt dawning of the Goſpel.
And <hi>Acts</hi> 8. We reade the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, to be
no leſs than thrice, particularly concerned, and acting
for the Salvation of the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Treaſurer; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention
ſo extraordinary and rare, that few, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men or Nations, can boaſt of the like. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if St. <hi>Peter</hi> could from one ſingle Example, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Salvation of <hi>all the Heathen,</hi> Acts 15. what
ſhould hinder, but from this <hi>Eunuch's</hi> ready ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and hearty acceptance of the Heavenly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
we alſo may infer the Calling and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of all the <hi>Negro's.</hi> And ſince that God, <hi>who
knoweth the Hearts,</hi> bare him witneſs, and did put
no difference between <hi>him</hi> and other <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but
<hi>purified his Heart by Faith: Why tempt we God,</hi> in
detaining them in Bondage to Hell (no leſs than to
our ſelves) for whom Chriſt died, and redeemed
them from thence?—And then proceeding to that
Example of <hi>Ebedmelech,</hi> Jer. 38. 39. he thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes;
—Both which being conſidered, it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(to uſe St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words in his Diſcourſe to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56561:47"/>
                     <hi>Cornelius;) That to them alſo, hath God granted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
unto Life;</hi> that they have Souls to be ſaved
no leſs than other People; and an equal <hi>Right</hi> even
with us, to the Merits of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Of which, if
through our Neglect or Avarice, they be deprived,
that Judgment which was denounced againſt wicked
<hi>Ahab,</hi> muſt befal us, <hi>Our life ſhall go for theirs:</hi> The
loſs of their Souls will be required at <hi>our Hands,</hi> to
whom God hath given ſo bleſſed an opportunity of
being inſtrumental to their Salvation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. VI. 1. My two former <hi>Propoſitions</hi> being finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I proceed now to the third; wherein, as a moſt
natural Inference, the Injuſtice of withholding this
Right from our <hi>Negro's,</hi> was no leſs poſitively decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
A thing ſo <hi>clear,</hi> that had I not heard and ſeen
the contrary, more than a thouſand times over, I
ſhould have thought it <hi>impoſſible</hi> once to be queſtioned,
or denied. For what can be more <hi>unjuſt,</hi> than to deny
any Man an apparent Right? Eſpecially a Right of
that conſequence even abſolutely neceſſary, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Eternity</hi> depends. If it be injurious to deprive a Man
of his Houſe, or Goods, the enjoyment whereof is
confined to the duration of but a few Years, (and
yet ſuch an <hi>Injury</hi> it is, as but few can bear); It muſt
certainly be no leſs, (rather a great deal more) op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
to thruſt him out of thoſe <hi>Eternal</hi> Manſions, and
from his Heavenly <hi>Father</hi>'s Houſe; to ſupplant him of
his Patrimony in the <hi>Celeſtial Canaan;</hi> and, as much as
in the Oppreſſor lieth, to rob him of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God?
An Injury of an endleſs permanency, and for which,
no place for amends nor <hi>reparation</hi> can be found! A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
if the reſtraining of ordinary Neceſſaries, as
<hi>Food, &amp;c.</hi> be an unmerciful <hi>Cruelty</hi> and Injuſtice to
the Parties, to whoſe <hi>Preſervation</hi> they are neceſſary
and <hi>due;</hi> How much more <hi>Barbarous</hi> and <hi>Inhumane</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:56561:47"/>
muſt it be to withhold from them the exerciſe of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
and the knowledg of <hi>God,</hi> equally needful for
the preſervation of their <hi>Souls?</hi> And if Slaves have
a Right to ſo much of their Labour as may furniſh
them with the <hi>firſt,</hi> (which, it is proved, they have)
certainly it will follow, that their Right is as great
to the <hi>latter.</hi> If the <hi>Negro's</hi> Maſter be in his Sickneſs
obliged to afford him ſuch <hi>Succour</hi> and Relief as may,
if poſſible, prevent the <hi>Anticipation</hi> of his Diſſolution
(for otherwiſe he is a Murtherer, and amongſt <hi>more
vertuous Chriſtians,</hi> would certainly be <hi>Arraigned</hi> for
one) doubtleſs he is equally bound to <hi>prevent</hi> his Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
It being, as the Orator teſtifies, againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Equity and Morality, to poſt-pone a <hi>leſſer</hi> evil
to a <hi>greater;</hi> to deſtroy a <hi>Man</hi> to ſave a <hi>Horſe;</hi> or in
a Man to throw away the <hi>Nobleſt</hi> and moſt <hi>Precious,</hi>
to ſave the more <hi>Dunghil</hi> and <hi>baſeſt</hi> part of him; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when obliged <hi>with equal care</hi> to preſerve the
whole; or if to beſtow any more on either, to prefer
the <hi>beſt,</hi> and that Eternity be allowed the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.
And this care, which carries its <hi>reward</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
with it, is but a moderate <hi>Retribution</hi> of the
Servant's Labour, tho to him of <hi>infinite</hi> value.</p>
               <p>2. And here may it not be demanded, Why the
<hi>Maſter</hi> who thinks this care as to <hi>Religion,</hi> needleſs for
his <hi>Slave,</hi> doth (as ſome would have it believed of
them) hold it needful for <hi>himſelf?</hi> Since the meaneſt
Slave hath a Soul of no leſs <hi>value,</hi> and to be preſerved
by the ſame means, with his. Or how comes his
Soul, being of but one and the ſame <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> to have
a better title to <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and the means of attaining
it, than the others, ſince that the holy Scripture, the
<hi>Charter</hi> of happineſs to Mankind, informs us of no
ſuch difference? Where the Servant that believes, is
by St. <hi>Paul</hi> dignified with this Privilege of being the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56561:48"/>
Lords<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Freedman,</hi> and thereby qualified
with a full Liberty and Freedom, to
partake of the Immunities of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and to the exerciſe of whatſoever
Actions ſhall be conducive to promote his intereſt in
<hi>Eternity,</hi> and to attain to the Bleſſings and Joys of
<hi>Heaven.</hi> And this, being ſo plainly there aſſerted;
and the moſt certain and <hi>Catholic</hi> Faith of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
no Man that profeſſeth an Aſſent to theſe, can,
without contradicting himſelf, gain-ſay it: Yea, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Infidel,</hi> may, from this owned and avowed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Chriſtianity, paſs <hi>ſentence</hi> againſt him, acting
ſo contrary thereto.</p>
               <p>3. And queſtionleſs from our <hi>Negro's</hi> being Slaves
to argue their no Right to <hi>Religion,</hi> is more Oppreſſive
and Injurious, than that Force which firſt made them
ſo: Becauſe ſtriking at their <hi>Souls,</hi> and ſubjecting
them to <hi>Hell,</hi> as much (only for a longer time) as
to their <hi>Tormenters</hi> here on Earth: And to have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
which, it might have been wiſhed, either that their
<hi>Creation</hi> had failed, or not exceeded this fancied ſtate
and degree of <hi>Brutes.</hi> And this Injuſtice muſt upon
all reſpects, be heightned by the conſideration of thoſe
great <hi>Ends</hi> unto which all Momentany advantages
ought to give way. Nor is it to be underſtood as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
only in the Sufferings of the <hi>wronged</hi> Party,
but directed and glancing at Him alſo, whoſe the
Soul of each Man is; whether in a Bond, or <hi>Freeman:</hi>
And <hi>who</hi> cannot be thought to <hi>reſent</hi> a Fact, ſo at once
Sacrilegious and Oppreſſive, leſs than an Earthly Prince
doth the <hi>Murthering</hi> of a <hi>Subject,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> whereof
is deſervedly made with his own, to waſh out and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
the loud cry of his Neighbours, or <hi>Fellow-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>'s
Blood. And as a <hi>Crime</hi> of this nature marks the
<hi>Oppreſſor</hi> with the blackeſt Guilt, ſo it cannot but ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him Obnoxious to the <hi>ſevereſt</hi> Vengeance, that a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56561:48"/>
provoked and <hi>juſt God</hi> can inflict upon him, both Body
and Soul; and <hi>probably, no leſs in this Life,</hi> than <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
in the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. I confeſs, as to the Proviſion for their Bodies,
they deny it not to be expedient, or fit to be allowed
them: But this, not as their <hi>Right,</hi> or <hi>Due,</hi> but as
conducive to the Maſters Convenience and <hi>Profit, The
moſt operative and univerſally owned Principle of this
Place,</hi> and indeed of the whole <hi>Plantations.</hi> They
conſider it only in order to the enabling their People to
undergo their <hi>Labour,</hi> without which themſelves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get <hi>Riches,</hi> and great Eſtates; but nothing (ſo
far as I could ever learn) for the Wretches <hi>Health</hi> and
Preſervation. And their both Diſcourſe and moſt
current Practice, do declare no leſs; in neither of
which doth appear much <hi>Tenderneſs.</hi> Pity to Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
being here reputed a <hi>puſillanimous</hi> weakneſs, and
a very back friend to Intereſt. Whence their Houſes

Which certainly are <hi>Inhumanities</hi> of the wrankeſt kind,

and good <hi>Law,</hi> then were the like formerly exerciſed
by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon the poor <hi>Americans.</hi> But from
which by a <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, then King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Emperour,</hi> they were moſt graciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed.
For which theſe alſo do ſeem to cry with their
utmoſt earneſtneſs unto the Government <hi>at Home;</hi> not
doubting but that in time they ſhall be heard.</p>
               <p>6. Nor are they very conſtant to that firſt and ſo
very <hi>agreeable</hi> Principle, of preſerving theſe poor
Wretches for Labour (their only end in purchaſing
of them,) by a due <hi>proviſion</hi> of Food (not likely to
put them to any extraordinary expences, whilſt little
better than what the <hi>Hogs</hi> do feed on, and is, to ſave
time, generally planted by themſelves upon <hi>Sundays):</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:56561:49"/>
And of <hi>Cloathing,</hi> for which a <hi>Canvaſs Shirt</hi> and
<hi>Drawers,</hi> during the two or three rainy Months
(which is all the <hi>Winter</hi> we have here) will ſuffice:
And laſtly, by allowing them time of Reſt, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
from Labour for their <hi>tired</hi> Bodies. I ſay,
they are very far from a conſtant acting according to
that <hi>Principle;</hi> unleſs where the benefit of preſerving,
ſhall exceed the dammage they are like to ſuſtain, by
ſuffering ſome few of them to be <hi>Starved,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to <hi>Periſh.</hi> That is, If three or four Hundred may
be more advantageouſly maintained (for it being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
which of them will out-live the other, they
muſt be at like <hi>Charges</hi> with each, if they would <hi>ſave</hi>
them all) then <hi>fifteen,</hi> or <hi>twenty</hi> new ones be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed,
to fill up the <hi>dead</hi> rooms, (for ſo many, or
more, are like to be wanting at the Years end, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſuch <hi>Proviſion:)</hi> I ſay, then 'tis poſſible that they
may fall to conſult their God, INTEREST, and
endeavour their <hi>Preſervation.</hi> Which kind of Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
are not ſo frequent among the <hi>Mightier,</hi> as
with the Middle and Meaner ſort; who do uſually
find it leſs convenient to <hi>buy new,</hi> than (having but a
few) to <hi>preſerve</hi> their old <hi>Negro's.</hi> Whereby both
their and the <hi>White Servants</hi> (the general name for <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans)</hi>
condition, is leſs miſerable under theſe, than
under the <hi>richer</hi> ſort; with whom the death of a good
<hi>Horſe,</hi> and of a <hi>Negro,</hi> is of equal moment, and doth
uſually extort from them the ſame expreſſions of Grief
and <hi>Sorrow;</hi> unleſs where the Horſe doth happen to be
of the greater <hi>Value.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. To this alſo I might add, as an effect of their
<hi>ſcant</hi> allowance of Food to their Slaves, the many
<hi>Robberies</hi> and <hi>Thefts</hi> committed by theſe ſtarved People
upon the poorer <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Of which, if I ſhould affirm
their owners to be the occaſion, by thus ſtarving of
them, I think I ſhould not hit much either beſide, or
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56561:50"/>
beyond the <hi>Mark.</hi> That they are not diſpleaſed at it,
<hi>if dexterouſly performed,</hi> is the general belief and ſenſe
of the <hi>Sufferers:</hi> And this is ſaid to be the true meaning
of that cuſtomary reply, <hi>Tuſh, they can ſhift,</hi> to the
Stewards and <hi>Overſeers</hi> requeſts for a ſupplie of the
<hi>Negro's</hi> want of Proviſion. Which ſuſpicion of their
Connivance, is further augmented by the ſmall <hi>Redreſs</hi>
that is given, or made to the injured parties, upon
their juſt Complaints; unleſs taking them in the <hi>Act,</hi>
they there ſhoot them dead; which is all the remedy
they can get: Whereby the <hi>Iſland</hi> is daily deſerted by
its Inhabitants. And this alſo is one of the chief Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
why Proviſions are ſo <hi>dear;</hi> no live <hi>Creature</hi>
being to be raiſed, or <hi>kept ſecure,</hi> but under Lock and
Key.</p>
               <p>8. I might here alſo add, that the <hi>Pickaninnies,</hi> or
young <hi>Negro</hi>-Children, except only the hardieſt,
wanting a due attendance and care of them, do moſt
of them periſh in their <hi>Infancy.</hi> Their <hi>Mothers</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
labour in the Field, not admiting a neceſſary care
or regard of them.</p>
               <p>9. Nor are theſe Miſeries the Fate only of the
<hi>Blacks,</hi> but, in a proportionable meaſure, of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>White People</hi> alſo, who generally <hi>are better wrought
than either fed or taught.</hi> And for their <hi>charity</hi> to the Sick,
tho brought even to Death's door, yet can they hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obtain the leaſt amendment in their <hi>Diet,</hi> tho never
ſo earneſtly importuned; their <hi>Condition</hi> and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances
no leſs <hi>pleading</hi> for them. I confeſs, I would not
here be ſuppoſed to charge all alike, where (poſſibly)
divers are to be excepted, <hi>tho to me unknown.</hi> And
theſe things have, beyond all diſpute, waſted more
<hi>Engliſh-Men,</hi> (not to mention <hi>Negro's,</hi> and other <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)</hi>
than are at this Day to be found in all <hi>America.</hi>
Who with better uſage, might have been of great
uſe to the Peopling of thoſe vaſt deſolate <hi>Regions:</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:56561:50"/>
And at the ſame time, contributed no ſmall Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Strength to their <hi>Mother-Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. And to give one Inſtance for all, of this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulneſs;
it was concerning <hi>one of theſe,</hi> and even
a <hi>Natural Subject</hi> of one of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Kingdoms,
tho not of <hi>England;</hi> and for an Accident wherein an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
deſerved the whole blame, (were any at all due,
which is queſtionable) that that <hi>execrable</hi> Speech men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before, <hi>Page</hi> 69. was uttered. But for
which, <hi>right or wrong,</hi> the poor Man ſuſtained an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Laſhes, or more. Seven <hi>Rods,</hi> each bearing five
Sprigs (which occaſions their name) nothing infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to our <hi>Willow,</hi> being ſpent upon him: Whereby
he was, to the aſtoniſhment of the Beholders, (ſome
whereof (no leſs than the party himſelf) are to me
very well known) many days after, ſeen, as it were
but one general <hi>Scab,</hi> all over. The barbarous <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
of it, in contempt of their <hi>Exſtacy</hi> and Affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then venting that blaſphemous Expreſſion:
And withal adding, <hi>That it was no leſs lawful for Men,
than for the Fiſh, or wild Beaſts, the greater and more
powerful to worry and deſtroy the reſt.</hi> A Speech better
becoming an <hi>Out-law,</hi> than a <hi>Judg.</hi> But from hence
may be argued, that if their Servants <hi>Bodies,</hi> in the
ſuſtaining whereof their <hi>Intereſt</hi> ſo much conſiſts, do
meet with no more mercy, their <hi>Souls</hi> muſt expect
much leſs; from ſuch who believe <hi>Religion</hi> an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
to their <hi>Profit;</hi> and with our King <hi>John,</hi> do
think, <hi>That a Stag may grow very fat, without ever hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Maſs.</hi> And that if theſe be ſo much neglected,
it cannot be imagined that the other ſhould once fall
under their conſideration. Nor is this the effect of
<hi>Sloth</hi> only, or a thing accidental; but by deſign, and
from a principle (next to their ſuppoſed <hi>Brutality)</hi>
ſpringing from the imaginary <hi>inexpedience</hi> thereof:
The <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> of thoſe <hi>foul</hi> Poſitions,

               </argument>
               <p>§. I. n. 1. NOthing then having hitherto appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of ſufficient force, to invalidate
our <hi>Negro's</hi> natural Right to the Privileges of <hi>Religion,</hi>
nor to acquit their <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> who hitherto have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
them from, at leaſt not acquaint them with it;
I come now to enquire whether certain great perſonal
<hi>Inconveniencies</hi> thereupon, as is pretended, neceſſarily
enſuing to their <hi>Owners;</hi> the many <hi>inſuperable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
or laſtly, the <hi>numerous Miſchiefs</hi> thereby threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56561:51"/>
at leaſt forbearance, notwithſtanding this <hi>Right,</hi> to
admit them thereunto.</p>
               <p>2. Before I reply unto which, I ſhall crave leave to
demand of them, What Nation, or <hi>Sect</hi> of Men, did
ever till now hold it Inexpedient, or <hi>not fit to perform
what was Juſt and Right?</hi> Certainly, none beſides
<hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Cut-throats,</hi> (or the late <hi>pretended</hi> Saints),
ſuch whoſe whole ſubſiſtence was by Violence and
<hi>Rapine,</hi> and therefore have been proclaimed <hi>Out-laws,</hi> and
reputed as <hi>common</hi> Enemies to Mankind: Fit <hi>Tutors</hi>
for thoſe that profeſs themſelves <hi>Diſciples and Scholars
of Chriſt!</hi> And yet even theſe, as <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerveth,
<hi>l. 2. Off.</hi> are <hi>forced to conſtitute Laws, unto which they
conform themſelves.</hi> And by an Inſtance of two noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Banditi,</hi> who <hi>by an even ſharing of their Purchaſe,
arrived to great Wealth,</hi> he further confirms his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the neceſſity of Juſtice: Which, he ſaith,
<hi>doth conſiſt in Equity, by ſupporting the Weak againſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors,
and obſerving an even indifferency, in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
thereof,</hi> both to high and low. And therefore
he tells us, that for this end, <hi>Leges ſunt inventae, quae
cum omnibus unâ atque eâdem voce loquerentur: Laws were
enacted, which ſhould indifferently ſpeak the ſame ſenſe and
language to all conditions and degrees alike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. And doubtleſs 'tis a thing agreable to Nature,
to maintain <hi>Right.</hi> A principle plainly legible in the
Practice, becauſe firſt planted and riveted in the
Hearts, of the moſt barbarous <hi>Nations.</hi> None of theſe
owning other, but that what <hi>was Juſt and Right,</hi> was
alike <hi>due to, and from all Men;</hi> and then certainly to
Slaves from their Superiours, ſo far as that Right
ſhould extend. And this without any byaſſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
by particular <hi>Intereſts,</hi> but guided by <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
the moſt exact Rule of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> Theſe
being not <hi>empty Names,</hi> but importing <hi>real Duties;</hi>
of which we are not to take our Meaſures by the <hi>vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:56561:52"/>
of our <hi>Ambition,</hi> or our unbounded <hi>Avarice,</hi> but
by the trueſt <hi>Reaſon,</hi> void of all diſturbance by <hi>Paſſion</hi>
and <hi>Corruption</hi> from by-Ends.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>To prove which, I might amaſs together whole
Pages of</hi> Quotations, <hi>out of the forementioned little
Volumn of</hi> Moral Duties, <hi>but ſhall at preſent content
my ſelf with Gleaning only a few out of that full
Stack, or Sheaff. As,</hi> That the foundations of Juſtice
are to hurt no Body, but to conſult the Good of all. That
we are born to Honeſty, and that Juſtice only can confer
on Men the Title of [Good.] That whatſoever is True,
Simple, and Sincere, is moſt agreeable to Man's Nature.
That nothing Cruel is profitable. That the endeavouring
after Wealth and Eſtates by juſt ways, is commendable;
but the contrary baſe and deteſtable. That they do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the foundations of Nature, who do ſeparate Profit and
Honeſty; <hi>It being horrid to imagin,</hi> that any profit can
be made by Injuſtice; <hi>yea,</hi> even at that very time <hi>when we</hi>
obtain <hi>the thing</hi> reputed thus profitable, <hi>it being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that</hi> theſe ſhould conduce to any Mans benefit. That
<hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to curſe thoſe Men, who firſt ſeparated
Profit and Honeſty: Nothing being profitable or expedient,
but ſo far as it is void of Baſeneſs. <hi>And moſt fully to
manifeſt and evice this</hi> Poſition, <hi>is the whole work
and deſign of that</hi> excellent <hi>Treatiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. And now let thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who pretend a
Neceſſity, for that which <hi>Heathens</hi> have in their ſeveral
Ages and Times, ſo ſiercely declaimed againſt, <hi>As miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
Men, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nnatural;</hi> and do pretend a <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi>
for that which <hi>no temptation of Profit</hi> could induce
them to accept, or aſſent to; and further do hold it
<hi>convenient,</hi> and even <hi>commendable,</hi> (as being the firſt
ſtep to <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Authority;)</hi> to compaſs Eſtates by
the moſt Sordid ways, which either the Examples of a
<hi>Corrupt Age,</hi> or their own <hi>fruitful</hi> Inventions can ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt.
And for this <hi>falſe</hi> end do deny their Slaves the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56561:52"/>
exerciſe and benefit of <hi>Religion,</hi> upon the pretended
<hi>Inconveniencies</hi> and imaginary <hi>Inexpedience</hi> of it; I ſay,
let them coolly weigh this <hi>virtuous Heathens</hi> reſolutions
<hi>concerning the neceſſity of Juſtice,</hi> and the <hi>turpitude of the
contrary</hi> Vice; and having ſo done, let them bethink
themſelves how little Right they have to that nobleſt
<hi>Appellative</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (if they at all care for it),
who do thus profeſſedly turn their Backs to common
<hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> And then to conſider whether of
the two, <hi>Themſelves,</hi> or their <hi>Slaves,</hi> by them kept in
ignorance of their <hi>Duty,</hi> be the <hi>blackeſt</hi> and wrankeſt
<hi>Heathens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. II. 1. And thus having from the conſent of
Nature and Reaſon made it evident, that <hi>Right</hi> and
<hi>Equity</hi> are in deſpite of all <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> to be compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with, I ſhall without further delay, betake my ſelf
to my Aſſertion, before laid down, <hi>viz. That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Chriſtianity,</hi> &amp;c. Which will beſt be proved by
looking into, and diſplaying to each view, the true
Nature and Notion of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which I underſtand
to be, <hi>A devoting of our ſelves to the Service of Chriſt,
and a ſtrict Obligation in defiance of the whole World, to
promote his Intereſt and Honour, even with the loſs of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is precious or dear unto us.</hi> Which Vow is to be
ſincerely and truly made and kept; the whole Action
being otherwiſe but meer <hi>Pageantry,</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And that this is the true <hi>Notion</hi> and ſence of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi>
not only the expreſs words of that ſolemn
<hi>Covenant,</hi> made betwixt God and our Souls, at our
initiation into it by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> doth ſhew; but alſo our
Bleſſed Lord's ſo often reiterated, and no leſs plain
Declaration, in <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this very <hi>Queſtion,</hi> do moſt
fully prove. As, when he forewarns his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that
<hi>Self-denial,</hi> and <hi>a renouncing of Worldly Affections,</hi>
with a firm reſolution to <hi>undergo the Croſs,</hi> that is,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56561:53"/>
                  <hi>All Loſſes and Sufferings,</hi> are Qualifications highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for all his Followers. He further alſo acquaints
us, that <hi>Houſes</hi> and <hi>Lands, Kindred</hi> and <hi>neareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and even <hi>Life it ſelf,</hi> are all to be ſlighted as baſe
and vile, in reſpect of our Duty to himſelf; The very
ſubſtance of our Vow in <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. And to place my <hi>Aſſertion</hi> beyond all Diſpute, I
ſhall here further note, That this in all Ages of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi>
hath been ſo underſtood, even till this very
Day. Hence St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Profeſſion, to <hi>lay down his
Life for his Maſter,</hi> was accepted by him; which he
afterwards performed, as alſo did the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
And the holy Scripture inſtances in St. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
and St. <hi>James,</hi> both early <hi>Martyrs</hi> and Witneſſes of
this Truth. And had this been otherwiſe the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<hi>Kalander,</hi> had not ſo long ſince been furniſhed
with ſo compleat and numerous an Army of thoſe
Noble <hi>Martyrs,</hi> as to Muſter up five thouſand for <hi>each
day</hi> throughout the Year. Who all of them, doubtleſs,
might have ſaved their Lives, had it not been more
for their Lord's <hi>Honour,</hi> and the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of his <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
(which they were thereby to promore), thus to
ſuffer the <hi>effuſion of their Blood</hi> for him, who by his
own Example of <hi>pouring out his Soul unto Death,</hi> did
firſt lead them the way thereto. And in the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
we have the examples of the Jewiſh Martyrs, who
were ſawn aſunder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſet before us for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by St. <hi>Paul:</hi> whoſe Afflictions alſo, muſtered up in
his latter Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, c.</hi> 11. with his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Exhortations to the like, and a <hi>reſiſtance even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Blood,</hi> that is, in contempt of Death; and of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Chriſt's</hi> Example, of <hi>ſuffering for the Truth;</hi>
aſſuring us that there is no other Way, or Gate, by
which we ſhould obtain an entrance into the <hi>Kingdom
of Heaven,</hi> but <hi>through much Tribulation,</hi> Acts 14. do
ſufficiently evidence, that this Doctrine was not to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56561:53"/>
expire with its great <hi>Author,</hi> but alway to remain a
neceſſary condition of <hi>Admittance</hi> into his Service and
Fellowſhip, ſo long as he was to have a <hi>Church</hi> upon
Earth; that is, till the <hi>Conſummation</hi> of the World.
Now, doubtleſs none of theſe were ſo much in love
with Death, but that willingly they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
their <hi>Lives,</hi> at the loſs only of their <hi>Eſtates,</hi>
or at leaſt, the whole with ſome part; could it have
been done without offending their Duty. So that
here were <hi>inconveniencies with a witneſs;</hi> yet there was
no avoiding them, ſo long as they knew themſelves
under this <hi>Obligation</hi> to their <hi>Saviour</hi> and Maſter
<hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Now here ſome (I do not ſay all), will grant
that they are indeed tied, <hi>not to deny Chriſt:</hi> But, ſay
they again, are they therefore bound to proclaim him,
or to perſuade others, who think themſelves <hi>much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
(or as well) already, to become his Servants and
Followers?</p>
               <p>5. To which, I anſwer, That, I ſuppoſe, they are:
And that, Firſt, as being <hi>abſolntely bound thereto,</hi> by
their very <hi>Profeſſion;</hi> that is, <hi>by their owning themſelves
for Chriſtians.</hi> The contrary being no leſs than a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of it: Becauſe it proceeds from a neglect
and even contempt thereof, than which nothing can
be more contrary thereto. And which when not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
through Fear, or by Accident, but ariſing
from Choice and Election; and withal attended with
a perſiſtance in and defence of it, is ſuch a clear indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of our diſaffection and no eſteem thereof, as to
amount to a plain denial; which every ſingle Sin,
tho of the groſſeſt kind, abſtracted from thoſe, doth not.
And therefore no Chriſtian can ever juſtifie his omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any poſſible-lawful means for the advancement of
his Religion; much leſs that which is indeed the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal.
Beſides, Chriſtianity is of its ſelf <hi>a profeſſion
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56561:54"/>
of doing Good,</hi> and <hi>of aſſerting</hi> (not concealing) <hi>the
Truth;</hi> which was the very end of our Bleſſed Lord's
<hi>coming into the World;</hi> as himſelf, St. <hi>John</hi> 18. 37.
witneſſeth, namely, <hi>to bear witneſs to the Truth;</hi> and
<hi>to ſeek and to ſave that which</hi> was periſhing, or quite <hi>loſt.</hi>
And therefore he was perpetually either imploying
himſelf in preaching and <hi>working of Miracles,</hi> or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Place to Place, and fetching many tedious
and weary Circuits, to find out Patients to exerciſe
his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> upon, and to <hi>Heal</hi> their Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers:
Removing Mens <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> from their Bodies,
thereby to work <hi>greater Cures</hi> upon their Souls: And,
without partiality or diſtinction, curing <hi>Servants</hi> and
<hi>Beggars</hi> of their <hi>Infirmities,</hi> reſtoring the <hi>Blind, Lame,
Deaf,</hi> and <hi>Dumb,</hi> without any reſpect to the <hi>quality,</hi>
but to the <hi>need</hi> of the Parties; and no leſs out of pure
humanity and pity to the <hi>Diſtreſſed,</hi> than for the <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
of doing Good. And from this Example and
Doctrine of the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the firſt Chriſtians did
not grudge to ſell their <hi>Houſes</hi> and <hi>Lands</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of others. Nor were they to confine and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
their <hi>Charity</hi> to the bounds of their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
(tho the <hi>Houſhold of Faith</hi> was in the firſt place
to be ſupplied) but were obliged <hi>to do good unto all
Men,</hi> not forgetting their very <hi>Enemies;</hi> much leſs
their <hi>Domeſtics</hi> and <hi>Slaves,</hi> by whoſe Labour they had
their whole Subſiſtance. Now if they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
obliged to relieve Mens <hi>Bodies,</hi> the worſer part,
much more were their <hi>Souls</hi> to have a ſhare in this
Charity: By their extraordinary <hi>Care</hi> for which laſt,
and their <hi>contempt</hi> of the Miſeries and Sufferings of the
other, when called to it, it was evident what value
they did put upon each. As knowing that if <hi>they
gained the whole World, with the loſs of their Souls,</hi> they
ſhould have had but little left to be boaſted of. And
if they held it their Duty to leave themſelves deſtitute
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56561:54"/>
even of an <hi>Houſe</hi> for ſhelter, and to part with their
<hi>Treaſures</hi> (the getting whereof did coſt them ſo much
Sweat and Care) for the good of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the
increaſe of <hi>Religion;</hi> themſelves in the mean while
depending only upon <hi>Providence;</hi> there is no doubt
but they preſumed it much more their Duty to beſtow
their <hi>Breath</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> which could coſt them no La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
beſides that of <hi>uttering them;</hi> nor any <hi>Expences</hi>
more than of the <hi>time</hi> therein laid out and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>
               <p>6. And conformable hereto, hath been the Practice
and Conſent of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in all Ages ſince. For
firſt of all St. <hi>Peter,</hi> being, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. forbidden <hi>to ſpeak
any more in the Name of Chriſt,</hi> remembring his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
and Calling, and knowing what a prejudice
to the Souls of Men his ſilence would prove, He, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
from <hi>Heaven,</hi> with the hazard of his Life,
perſiſts and goes on; boldly in the moſt public place
(even in the <hi>Temple)</hi> like a true Miniſter and Apoſtle,
<hi>ſpeaking all the words pertaining to this Life,</hi> that is, to
<hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> And thoſe Chriſtians that <hi>were ſcattered
abroad upon the Perſecution which aroſe about</hi> Stephen,
travelled into remoter Regions; but <hi>there preached the
Word;</hi> ſome <hi>to the Jews only,</hi> whilſt others preached
to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo: Both concurring in this Sentence,
That they underſtood it to be their Duty to promote
the Doctrine of their <hi>Lord,</hi> in whatſoever Territory
they ſhould happen to be caſt. This was the cauſe of
St. <hi>Paul's</hi> toylſome Journeys into <hi>Syria, Greece, Spain,
Rome,</hi> &amp;c. Others of the Apoſtles piercing into <hi>India,</hi>
and in a few Years ſubduing more Kingdoms to <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
than the <hi>Roman Eagles</hi> had conquered in many Ages.
Nor did Religious Chriſtians think it any Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to imploy their utmoſt <hi>Skill</hi> to advance this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Beſides, the Charity and Love of Souls, did
beighten their <hi>Zeal</hi> to the effectual <hi>deſtroying the works
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56561:55"/>
of the Devil,</hi> and to reſcue out of <hi>his Snares, thoſe that
were taken Captive at his will.</hi> Nor could they be at
reſt till they had eſtabliſhed him, their moſt Natural
Lord, in his <hi>Hereditary</hi> Dominions <hi>over the Heathen,</hi>
and extended his Authority <hi>even to the utmoſt parts of
the Earth:</hi> Such was the deep ſence they had of this
Duty. And therefore Tradition hath delivered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that the Apoſtles by Lot, like ſo many great <hi>Generals</hi>
going to take in Cities, and conquer Provinces; ſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves to travel into the moſt diſtant Regions,
for the effectual carrying on of <hi>this</hi> great <hi>Work:</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that <hi>they knew there were no Dignities nor
Preferments to be any where expected, beſides Affliction and
Martyrdom.</hi> Whereof St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> is ſaid to have
betook himſelf to <hi>India;</hi> St. <hi>Thomas</hi> to <hi>Parthia;</hi> St.
<hi>Andrew</hi> to <hi>Scythia;</hi> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> to <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> and St.
<hi>Matthias</hi> is ſaid to have adventured amongſt the <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals.</hi>
So that no <hi>People,</hi> how Barbarous, or Remote
ſoever; nor any <hi>Clime,</hi> tho portending nothing but
Deſtruction and <hi>Calamity</hi> to them, nor even the moſt
apparent and affrighting Dangers, could by any means
divert them (as by an Inſtance we have, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 13.
of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s reſolution, is manifeſt) from proſecuting
<hi>this ſo glorious a Deſign,</hi> ſo much by us ſlighted: Who
inſtead of taking ſuch difficult Voyages, do (even the
beſt of us) ſcarcely <hi>wiſh well to them;</hi> and do think it
enough to propagate the Goſpel in <hi>Fable only,</hi> and as
at the <hi>Iſle of Pines.</hi> Never taking care to teach the
<hi>Natives,</hi> where we come, any <hi>Good;</hi> but to learn them
in all the <hi>Evil,</hi> which we practice our ſelves.</p>
               <p>7. Nor did this Zeal die with the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and
their immediate <hi>Succeſſours,</hi> but did ſhine moſt brightly
in the Chriſtians of the following Ages: Neither <hi>Sex</hi>
(according to its Capacity) believing it ſelf <hi>exempted
from this Service.</hi> For as Women are ſaid to have been
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> to the Apoſtles, ſo the <hi>Iberians,</hi> as <hi>Socrates</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56561:55"/>
                  <hi>l. 1. c.</hi> 15, 16. do own their firſt knowledg of
the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to a <hi>poor She-Captive.</hi> Which no doubt was
by her at firſt undertaken and acted, out of a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of
her Duty, (ſuch an opportunity being providentially
adminiſtred to her); and the common Principles of
all Chriſtians directing her thereto.</p>
               <p>8. After the like manner we read, that the middle
<hi>India</hi> was converted by two Strangers, their Names
<hi>Frumentius,</hi> and <hi>Aedeſius.</hi> And <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in his <hi>l.</hi> 5.
<hi>c.</hi> 20. of <hi>Eccl. Hiſtory,</hi> writes of St. <hi>Panten us,</hi> (whom
he ſtiles <hi>a moſt famous Man, for) that he ſhewed ſo much,
and ſuch Divine Zeal for the Word of God, that he went
to preach it to the Indians:</hi> Either to ſubdue ſome
new <hi>Province,</hi> or to perfect what another had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
               <p>9. And it was very early that St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
or St. <hi>Simon Zelotes,</hi> or St. <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea,</hi> or St.
<hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> or ſome other of the <hi>Apoſtolic</hi> Age (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they were) came into <hi>Britain,</hi> to give it the
<hi>Honour</hi> of having <hi>the firſt Chriſtian King.</hi> And the
<hi>Britains</hi> when invaded by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> did not, ſome of
them (as St. <hi>Kentigern,</hi> and others) ceaſe to follow thoſe
Examples; they thinking it their <hi>Duty</hi> to do this <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>
to their very Enemies, and to preach to them, for
their Salvation, who ſought their Lives, and their
Countries Deſtruction. Tho this, being not ſo heartily
carried on and purſued by them as was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
did afterwards give <hi>Gildas</hi> their Country-man,
great occaſion of complaint againſt them.</p>
               <p>10. For a ſupply whereof, St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> moved (as <hi>V. Bede</hi> piouſly diſcourſeth) <hi>by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
from God,</hi> ſent <hi>Auguſtine</hi> with other Religious
Men to preach to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Who, being <hi>converted
to the Faith,</hi> did themſelves become no leſs zealous
<hi>Propagators</hi> thereof, both at home and abroad: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been the happy Converters of the <hi>Haſſians, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conians,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56561:56"/>
Turingians,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> the
<hi>Friſians,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders, Norwegians,</hi> and <hi>Lithuanians.</hi>
For not to reckon up <hi>Felix, Berinus,</hi> and <hi>Agilbertus,</hi>
St. <hi>Aidanus</hi> and <hi>Columbanus;</hi> all Foraigners, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
to the <hi>Saxons</hi> Converſion: Nor yet that
Religious King St. <hi>Oſwald,</hi> who himſelf out of his
great Zeal to promote the Faith of Chriſt in his own
Kingdom, did not think ſcorn to become Interpreter
to <hi>Aidanus</hi> as he preached, and to give the ſence of the
Sermon to his Attendants, as <hi>Aidanus,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
not <hi>Engliſh,</hi> delivered it. I ſay, not much to
inſiſt upon theſs, we reade of St. <hi>Willibrood, Boniface,</hi>
and Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the Fourth, with divers other <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen,</hi>
the Converters of theſe Nations; And our
<hi>V. Bede</hi> tells us of the two <hi>Henwalds,</hi> ſuffering <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom</hi>
by adventuring into <hi>Saxony,</hi> upon the like
Errand.</p>
               <p>11. And ſo far were our Anceſtors perſuaded of the
neceſſity of this Duty, that <hi>if any thing happened amiſs
to them, they concluded it to ariſe from this Neglect.</hi> Hence
<hi>Kenwalchus,</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> obſerving his
Affairs not to ſucceed very proſperouſly; he reſolves
to amend that Fault: Of which Reformation he ſoon
found the effects, in the Proſperity which thereupon
enſued. <hi>But all ſuch Conſiderations are ridiculous amongſt
Atheiſts.</hi> And therefore when one Mr. <hi>A. B.</hi> in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi>
offered his Service in order thereto, he was
laughed to Scorn by the <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They, at leaſt ſome of
them, with a Scoff replying, That thoſe who go upon
that Work, are to <hi>provide neither Purſe nor Scrip;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had made ſome Propoſal alſo concerning
Maintenance.</p>
               <p>12. 'Tis true indeed, our <hi>Church</hi> upon the laſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view</hi>
of the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> doth ſeem to have had an Eye
thereto, when in Her Preface ſhe declared, <q>
                     <hi>That the
Office for Baptizing thoſe of riper Years, may be alſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56561:56"/>
for the baptizing of Natives in the Plantations, and
others Converted to the Faith.</hi>
                  </q> Such was her tender
care for the Souls of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> in that moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Proviſion. But, alas! the Enemies of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
have fruſtrated and defeated our hopes, ſo far,
that for any uſe the ſaid <hi>Office</hi> hath been put to here,
it might almoſt as well have been left out. However,
from theſe few Inſtances which I have taken out of
<hi>Church Hiſtory,</hi> as Water out of a common River,
(whereof every Man may take enough, without Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
or Injury to any other), may be ſeen how zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
former Ages were for the <hi>Converſion</hi> of Heathens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which they looked upon as a Duty conſequent to their
Baptiſm, and without which they could not challenge
the Name of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And ſo much for my firſt
Reaſon.</p>
               <p>13. But ſecondly, If this be not the Duty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
then muſt <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> fall ſhort of the Piety of
<hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> whoſe <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and Learned Men, as they
aimed at nothing ſo much as the knowledg and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition</hi>
of the <hi>Truth;</hi> ſo next of all was their deſire of
converting and winning others, with them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the ſame. Who yet knew nothing of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thereof, beyond the <hi>ſatisfaction of doing Good,</hi>
and of being inſtrumental to advance <hi>Society.</hi> Which
Conſiderations ought to be more prevalent with <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
as having promiſes of <hi>Rewards for whatſoever
good thing</hi> is done by them, <hi>not only in this Life, but in
that which is to come.</hi> And the Heathens Notion of a
<hi>Good Man,</hi> was from hence derived, <hi>viz. From doing
all the good he could:</hi> Whilſt they held a ſelf-ended Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in the greateſt deteſtation. Now Chriſtianity is
but <hi>Morality,</hi> ſtrained to the higheſt pin: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Lord preſcribes to his Diſciples, the <hi>righteouſneſs
of the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> (that is, of the ſtricteſt
<hi>Jews)</hi> not only for our bare Imitation, <hi>but to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56561:57"/>
by us.</hi> One of whoſe <hi>principal Vertues,</hi> we reade,
it was that they <hi>compaſſed Sea and Land to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes.</hi>
And certainly then a Chriſtian is much more
obliged thereto.</p>
               <p>14. Thirdly, We are hereunto tied by our Covenant
in <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> wherein we promiſe <hi>to fight manfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Sin,</hi> which no man can fully anſwer, that doth
not firſt fight againſt <hi>Infidelity.</hi> Hereby alſo we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
to be faithful Servants to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> during the Term
of our whole Lives: Which work of Converting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
is the moſt <hi>grateful</hi> ſervice that we can perform.
For certainly it had otherwiſe never been ſo often preſt
and recommended with ſuch promiſes in holy
Scripture; As, <hi>He that winneth Souls is wiſe,</hi> Prov.
11. 30. <hi>And they that be Wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and they <hi>that turn many unto Righteouſneſs, as the
Stars for ever and ever,</hi> Dan. 12. And <hi>the reducing one
fallen from</hi> (and ſurely 'tis the ſame if he never knew)
<hi>the Truth,</hi> is in ſome ſenſe made <hi>Meritorious,</hi> St.
<hi>James</hi> 5. 20. Nay further, it is ſo much our Duty, that
'tis Heatheniſh to neglect it, as (beſides what I have
before in this <hi>Sect.</hi> ſaid) may be inferred from thoſe
general words of the 4th <hi>Chap.</hi> and the laſt <hi>Ver.</hi> of the
ſame <hi>Epiſtle.</hi> And if by the Husbands cauſleſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudiating
of his Wife, he in that Act <hi>cauſeth her to
commit</hi> (and ſo is guilty of her) <hi>Adultery;</hi> by the like
parity of Reaſon, <hi>He that hinders his Servant from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
muſt be guilty of his Infidelity.</hi> And in a word,
ſo natural it is for Men to promote the Faith which
themſelves do believe, that with the Barbarians of
<hi>Japan,</hi> we may ſafely conclude them for no <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
that do neglect it. And not only as in our ſubjection
to Earthly Maſters, to whom our Strength and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is due; but in this Covenant of Baptiſm, we
bind and make over our Souls and Affections to <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
no leſs than our Bodies. Now let theſe be but <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:56561:57"/>
imployed by us, and 'tis not poſſible but they
muſt reflect ſome <hi>improvement</hi> to this Service. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
where the Agent is fully armed with <hi>abſolute</hi>
Authority, and thoſe on whom he is to lay out his
endeavours being his <hi>Slaves;</hi> and ſo, tho <hi>diſaffected</hi>
thereto (which they are not) yet might ſoon be brought
over, by one having <hi>Power</hi> to make them ſubmit and
bend their Inclinations to his <hi>own.</hi> Tho at firſt
perchance leſs cordially (that is, where there is
any diſlike, which I muſt avow that here there is not;)
yet in an outward Compliance at leaſt; And even this
diſaffection, <hi>cuſtom</hi> and long <hi>uſe</hi> would in time <hi>wear
out,</hi> and make the contrary become <hi>Natural.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>15. And this doth ſeem to come down to our Caſe,
wherein we have a perfect concurrence in all the parts,
except only <hi>in the Principal.</hi> The <hi>Maſters</hi> profeſſing
themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> their Slaves being indeed <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi>
but giving no proof of any Malice, or diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>Religion.</hi> The <hi>Maſters</hi> armed with full power
over them; and having themſelves <hi>vowed</hi> to imploy
that whole Power, and <hi>all that is theirs beſides,</hi> in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Yet for a petty inconſiderable <hi>Intereſt,</hi> to be
certainly recompenced with much greater Advantages
(as will ſoon be ſhewed), <hi>refuſing to promote that Faith</hi>
(which they themſelves do own) <hi>among thoſe of their
own Families.</hi> Now if this be to comply with ſuch
<hi>Obligations,</hi> then may it be concluded, that a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
hath a mighty Advantage above other Men; and
that he may, without the leaſt <hi>guilt</hi> or <hi>ſtain</hi> to his Soul,
both <hi>ſwear and forſwear</hi> whatſoever his <hi>Intereſt</hi> ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
him to.</p>
               <p>16. I confeſs, I do not hold it to be alike every
Man's Duty to labour herein; but do yet dare to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it every <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Duty to concern himſelf about
it, ſo far as his condition of Subſiſtence and living,
and his <hi>knowledg</hi> ſhall enable him. For as Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:56561:58"/>
in his <hi>Dialogue concerning Preaching,</hi> P. 57. tells us,
<q>Every private Chriſtian may, and ought to preach
in this Senſe. Every ſuch is a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
that is, it is his Duty to teach them the great
things of <hi>Religion,</hi> according to the beſt of his Skill
and Knowledg. This is one way to <hi>provide for our
Families,</hi> and 'tis the moſt neceſſary. <hi>Men had better
neglect the getting their Children and Servants Bread and
Clothes, then to omit their care about this greater and
more needful Proviſion.</hi>
                  </q> It's true, 'tis not perchance
every Mans Duty to traverſe the World from one
Quarter to the other, to preach the Goſpel, and to
Convert <hi>Heathens.</hi> But if they happen to be brought
<hi>Home</hi> to us, and made members of our Families, we
are, <hi>beyond diſpute,</hi> each Soul of us obliged, <hi>as we ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our own Salvation,</hi> to endeavour theirs. That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatory,
1 <hi>Cor. 7. 16. How knoweſt thou,</hi> &amp;c? car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
in it an Argument greatly enforcing the like <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable</hi>
care and endeavours for the ſaving of <hi>others,
tho lodged at a remoter diſtance from us, than our Boſoms:</hi>
For he whoſe whole buſineſs it is <hi>to do good,</hi> muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be <hi>idle,</hi> whilſt there are any objects of his Charity,
<hi>eſpecially under his Roof:</hi> For he fails of his <hi>Duty</hi> ſo
much, as he falls ſhort in any particular <hi>Office within
his power,</hi> though of an inferiour nature to this. And
if unmercifulneſs be the only Crime obſervable from
our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Charge at the Day of Judgment, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. Doubtleſs, they that have thus
cruelly treated their <hi>Slaves;</hi> and, what in them lieth,
<hi>deſtroyed their Souls,</hi> ſhall then find an <hi>Hell</hi> hotter than
ordinary, and like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Furnace, <hi>heated
ſeven times more;</hi> and a <hi>Devil,</hi> proportionably mercileſs,

offer ſome things by way of <hi>Excuſe:</hi> As, 1. The <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,</hi>
and, as they pretend, even <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing upon them. 2. Their want of <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
3. Their <hi>Stupidity,</hi> and utter <hi>incapacity</hi> for Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Laſtly, Their <hi>irreconcileable averſeneſs</hi> and hatred
to all <hi>Religion.</hi> All which are certainly <hi>falſe of the
major part of them,</hi> at leaſt of <hi>divers,</hi> as my ſelf, upon
my particular knowledg and experience can truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.
But as to the ſecond, there are, 1. Many who
have lived a conſiderable time in the <hi>Iſland.</hi> 2. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that were born in it. A <hi>3d</hi> ſort that have been
brought up and baptized in <hi>England;</hi> who can <hi>all of
them ſpeak Engliſh,</hi> no worſe than the natural born Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of that Kingdom. Theſe I preſume will make
more than one <hi>moity</hi> of the whole. And for the reſt,
even the very <hi>Novices</hi> of them, I do not ſee why they
ſhould not be as capable of <hi>Religion</hi> as of <hi>Buſineſs.</hi> But
it is notoriouſly known, that even thoſe of the <hi>third
ſort</hi> (when Trapand hither) are as little regarded as
the raweſt <hi>Barbarian</hi> in the whole herd: And ſo of
thoſe whom themſelves have cauſed to be Baptized in
<hi>England,</hi> whereof I have ſpoken, <hi>P.</hi> 37. in the former
Chapter. And it is no leſs certain, that their very
<hi>Domeſtics,</hi> that attend them in their <hi>Chambers,</hi> and at
their <hi>Tables</hi> (the reſt living in ſheds, and ſeparated
places <hi>without Doors,</hi> purpoſely allotted for them)
are taught to avoid the room (which alſo <hi>hath been
obſerved of them in</hi> England) as often as Prayers do
happen to be ſaid or read: As if there were ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Charm, or power of doing miſchief in Prayers.
Nor are they forced thence out of any <hi>ſcruple,</hi> or (ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious)
fear <hi>of having their Services polluted, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixture
of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers</hi> (a Nicety never here heard
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56561:59"/>
of); but only upon this Suppoſition, of <hi>the no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
thereof, nor benefit to Negro's, or other Slaves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And as for their <hi>Averſeneſs,</hi> a charge moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be returned upon the <hi>Objecters own Heads;</hi> I
have always found them rather <hi>fond and deſirous</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> than any way <hi>averſe</hi> thereto;
which a certain paſſage in Mr. <hi>Ligon's</hi> Deſcription of
this Iſland, will further evince: Tho, as in that caſe
(and <hi>here I will ſuggeſt the worſt),</hi> this deſire might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
firſt ariſe only from an Ambition of being like the
<hi>Engliſh:</hi> Which ſhould be no wonder, eſpecially in
People, who have never ſo much as heard <hi>whether there
were any Salvation, or Heaven for them,</hi> but rather the
contrary. But our People being extraordinary Wiſe,
have to prevent further Trouble, always taken it for
granted that their <hi>Negro's</hi> have an Antipathy againſt
<hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Nor are they upon a due trial and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
<hi>deſirous to underſtand other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. And here, if it might not occaſion too great an
<hi>expence</hi> of Time, (for which reaſon I ſhall be brief)
I ſhould crave leave to rehearſe a Portion more, of the
above mentioned <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Diſcourſe, wherein I have
an <hi>Apologie</hi> for them upon this Account, ready formed
to my hand, in theſe words:—<q>But are their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſo much altered from what they were? Surely,
the ſacred <hi>Text</hi> doth furniſh us with too notable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of Piety and Goodneſs, in theſe People. The
firſt is that of <hi>Ebedmeleck,</hi> Jer. 28. whoſe compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that <hi>Prophet</hi> in interceding for him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
delivering him out of the <hi>Dungeon,</hi> was ſo highly
pleaſing unto God, that in the next Chapter we find
this high commendation and <hi>Eulogium</hi> given him,
<hi>That he had put his truſt in the Lord;</hi> and therefore
had a promiſe of preſervation from thoſe <hi>fatal</hi> Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
which ſuddenly befel that <hi>ſtubborn</hi> People, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
who he then lived.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:56561:59"/>
4. <q>The ſecond is that of Queen <hi>Candace's</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,
<hi>Acts</hi> 8. who though a <hi>Dynaſt,</hi> of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with his Prince, travelled ſo long a Journey,
only to worſhip God at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Judg all the
World, whether this <hi>African,</hi> notwithſtanding the
<hi>blackneſs of his Face,</hi> had not a <hi>whiter Soul,</hi> than
moſt of our <hi>European</hi> refined Chriſtians! But this is
not all; behold him ſparing no time from his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but, <hi>As he ſate in his Chariot, he read the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
Iſaiah. And then ſee him attentively liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Heavenly Doctrine of St. <hi>Philip,</hi> earneſtly
thirſting after the Baptiſmal Waters; Which having
obtained, he <hi>goes on rejoycing,</hi> and haſting to make
known <hi>the glad tidings of his Saviour</hi> to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men.
It was this <hi>Noble-man's</hi> commendation,
that he did not think himſelf too great <hi>to be God's
Servant,</hi> and that <hi>amidſt his Pomp, he could attend
Religion:</hi> And to give him his due praiſe, I do not
ſee but that this <hi>black Prince</hi> may be a Copy for the
beſt of us to write after; a Pattern <hi>worthy the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Profeſſor's Imitation;</hi> and of whom, to uſe our
Saviour's words, I may ſay, <hi>Verily, I have not found
ſo great Faith, no not in</hi> Iſrael,</q> &amp;c. By which words
of this <hi>Sermon,</hi> the Preacher doth evidently confute
this malicious ſuggeſtion, touching the <hi>Negro's</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
natural averſion to <hi>Religion.</hi> And in truth,
ſome of our People do in part confeſs no leſs, when
in <hi>England,</hi> to prevent <hi>Obloquy</hi> (not regarded by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of them) for the Credit of their Iſland, (and no
leſs to make a fair ſhew) they procure, at leaſt give
way to, the <hi>Baptizing</hi> of their Attendants, as I have
before mentioned. (Like thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> who to
ſave their Places and Credits at once, do dare to be
guilty of that ſuperſtition at twenty miles diſtance,
which they will not adventure upon nearer Home).
It were to be wiſhed upon their return, that, laying
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56561:60"/>
aſide that ſuſpicion of <hi>Averſeneſs,</hi> (which they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
grant to be but a <hi>Fiction),</hi> they would remember to
compleat <hi>here,</hi> what they <hi>there</hi> began. It being to be
preſumed that the many thouſands remaining, have
<hi>the like precious Souls,</hi> tho not bleſſed with ſetting
foot upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soil. But this would go near too
much to affront the Principle here, (of which, Mr.
<hi>Ligon,</hi> whom I but now mentioned, gives an Account
in the Reply that one made to him, upon a Motion of
the like nature) and <hi>ſcandalize</hi> their <hi>weak Brethren:</hi>
Who might be apt to ſuſpect them for <hi>Chriſtians indeed,</hi>
and <hi>Apoſtates</hi> to the Cauſe; ſhould they openly perſiſt
to commit a thing ſo contradictory <hi>to their long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Irreligion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Howbeit notwithſtanding theſe ſo <hi>pregnant</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and their own knowledg and experience to
the contrary, to make out this <hi>Averſeneſs,</hi> they relate
a ſtory of a thing called a <hi>Chappel</hi> belonging to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Family, wherein a <hi>Preachment</hi> (for <hi>Sermon</hi> I ſhall
not call it, the <hi>Speaker</hi> wanting his <hi>Orders,</hi> together
with divers other very requiſite Qualifications) was
made each <hi>Sunday</hi> in the Afternoon; the <hi>Holder-forth</hi>
(notwithſtanding his ſaid <hi>Infirmity</hi> as to <hi>Orders,</hi> &amp;c.)
being uſually taken up in a
<hi>Parochial</hi> charge in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.<note place="margin">With this Perſon it was cuſtomary for him to <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize</hi> in the Neighbouring Pariſhes; and that at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-rates (which <hi>was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſpoil the Trade.)</hi> He would alſo joyn Couples in <hi>Marriage,</hi> and do any Offices where Mony was to be got; the <hi>Miniſters</hi> being not able to prevent nor hinder him; The <hi>Veſteries</hi> (who <hi>are our Supreme Church-Governours)</hi> not favouring their Complaints, as being <hi>themſelves</hi> not willing to be <hi>confin'd:</hi> Nor have the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> even <hi>thoſe in Orders,</hi> much cauſe to be diſpleaſed, <hi>themſelves</hi> (eſpecially <hi>the more popular)</hi> uſually taking the liberty of their <hi>Neighbours</hi> Pariſhes and Pulpits upon all occaſions, both without and <hi>againſt the Proprietors</hi> conſent.</note>
Now unto this our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
<hi>Africans,</hi> being admitted,
(for which <hi>Supererrogation,</hi>
the good Man <hi>the Maſter was
heartily laught at,</hi> tho with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cauſe, as I ſhall ſhew;)
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56561:60"/>
were not in the leaſt <hi>edified.</hi> Nor did they at all ſeek
after <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> the neceſſity and benefit whereof <hi>they
were never taught.</hi> Nor could they ſo much as repeat
the <hi>Lord's Prayer, Creed,</hi> or <hi>Decalogue,</hi> becauſe the
<hi>Speaker,</hi> attending higher Doctrines and <hi>Speculations</hi>
(tho I take him for no <hi>Fanatic)</hi> did never acquaint
them therewith: This and Catechizing, being with
the generality (whom he was to <hi>pleaſe, or all was
gone)</hi> quite out of Faſhion. Nor did theſe ſilly
<hi>Negro's,</hi> ſo much as underſtand wherefore they were
brought thither, it being never told them. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<hi>Doctor,</hi> believing his Reputation might be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed,</hi>
if in his <hi>Zeal</hi> (of which <hi>he was not at all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected)</hi>
he had condeſcended to apply any part of
his Diſcourſe to them, ſo much as in <hi>private,</hi> but much
more in <hi>publique;</hi> which indeed <hi>is the mighty dread</hi> of
ſome others beſides him. Whereby under <hi>theſe great
means,</hi> the <hi>Negro's,</hi> who were quartered in the moſt
diſtant part of their Meeting-place, remained ſtill as
<hi>brutiſh</hi> as even <hi>the more learned Engliſh,</hi> unto whoſe
wiſer Capacities the lofty <hi>Harang</hi> was ſolely fitted
and directed, without the leaſt <hi>application</hi> to the other.
Who poor Wretches, apprehended (and, I believe,
<hi>truely enough)</hi> their being brought thither to be no
other than a <hi>ſpecious</hi> pretence, only to cheat them of
their <hi>Dance</hi> and <hi>Muſick,</hi> and to abridg their <hi>Liberty,</hi> their
other <hi>work</hi> being over; (like thoſe who by their <hi>zeal</hi>
for the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> do reap this great <hi>ſpiritual</hi> advantage
of having their Servants thereby always in their eye:)
They in the mean time eſteeming the <hi>Church</hi> for their
<hi>Priſon.</hi> Which is no wonder, <hi>our whiter People</hi> (as
we diſtinguiſh) <hi>being much of the ſame Faith, touching
going to Church, and Religion:</hi> For otherwiſe our few
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56561:61"/>
and narrow Churches could not upon Sundays even
in the <hi>Mornings</hi> (for in the <hi>Afternoons</hi> we ſeldom Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble,
as contrary <hi>to the more laudable cuſtom of our
Colonies)</hi> amongſt ſuch multitudes of People, be ſo
thin and empty. But notwithſtanding from this <hi>ſingle
Inſtance</hi> (not to be parallel'd in all the <hi>Plantations,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in <hi>New-England)</hi> decrepit and ſimple as it is,
they very roundly infer this general concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> of
the ſtrange <hi>Antipathy</hi> of <hi>Negro's</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Which,
(admitting it in any part for true) cannot certainly
be greater, than <hi>to Work and Labour;</hi> and yet their
<hi>Taskmaſters</hi> have (notwithſtanding) a <hi>Faculty</hi> to make
them willing: And might no queſtion bring about the
other with equal facility, would they apply themſelves
to it, <hi>with but half the induſtry and affection</hi> they ſhew
towards theſe. Nor is it likely that their <hi>prejudices to
Religion</hi> (not, as I have often ſaid, in the leaſt diſcernable
in any of them) ſhould make them unwilling to part
with an hour from the <hi>heat</hi> of the Field, to be ſpent
in no harder Service, than <hi>learning their Prayers,</hi> with
other neceſſary parts of <hi>Religion,</hi> at reſt and <hi>under the
cool ſhade.</hi> A priviledg never like to be obtained for
them, whilſt the World is ſo <hi>rivetted</hi> in our Peoples
Hearts; who, would they but be <hi>leſs good natur'd
to themſelves,</hi> might find as great Inſtances (it may be
much greater) of untractableneſs and <hi>ſtupidity</hi> even
at Home, and amongſt <hi>Engliſhmen;</hi> who yet muſt not
therefore (and here I pray mark our great <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
partiality) be ſtraightways reputed unmeet to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Chriſtians;</hi> much leſs denied to be Men. But,
even admitting the whole Charge, yet they might
have fetcht this alleaged Averſeneſs, from a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
and nearer Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>deriſion</hi> with which
themſelves do uſually entertain all Diſcourſes about
<hi>Religion,</hi> and their diſreſpect and barbarous treating
of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of it; whereof theſe <hi>Negro's</hi> cannot
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56561:61"/>
be ignorant. Tho poſſibly no leſs alſo from the
ſame reaſon, for which the <hi>Americans</hi> are ſaid to
have <hi>diſaffected Heaven,</hi> namely, the Cruelties exerciſed
by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> over them.</p>
               <p>§. IV. 1. But yet further to acquit themſelves of
all <hi>Injuſtice</hi> in this Point (tho at no leſs rate than
Blaſphemy), they are not aſhamed ſome of them to
affirm, that the <hi>Negro's</hi> belief in the Deity is more
<hi>ſimple, pure,</hi> and <hi>ſincere</hi> than the Chriſtians: Others
of them do flatter themſelves with a like wicked <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
of the <hi>no neceſſity of Chriſtianity,</hi> in order to attain
Salvation; whilſt by a falſe <hi>Key</hi> of Imagination, they
open Heaven Gates, and do very frankly beſtow <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
upon <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens;</hi> Accounting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Opinion to proceed from the <hi>ill nature</hi> and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs
of Melancholy <hi>Religioniſts</hi> and <hi>Churchmen:</hi>
So alſo that the <hi>Jews</hi> believe ſufficiently of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by
their expectation of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come. And this
I have heard maintained, not by our <hi>Dunghil Wits,</hi> but
by the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> of the place. All which impious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
do but beſpeak their Malice againſt <hi>Religion,</hi>
and at the beſt do ſeem to affirm no leſs than that
<hi>Chriſt's coming into the World,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">My indignation againſt theſe Blaſphemies, forbids me to conceal them; the Authors whereof are Perſons conſiderable for Place and withal the grand enemies of Religion, no leſs than of the Miniſtry.</note> 
                  <hi>was either a Fiction,</hi>
(which he that openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
his—to be as honeſt
a Woman as the <hi>moſt glorious
and bleſſed VIRGIN,</hi> no
doubt believed) <hi>or to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi>
Thereby rendring the
Preaching of the Apoſtles,
and the Faith of all Chriſtians
(their own alſo, if they have any), to be but vain,
if <hi>Salvation may be had as well, or better without it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. For certainly, were this true, it had not been need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
for St. <hi>Peter</hi> to have adviſed the Zealous <hi>Jews,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56561:62"/>
Acts</hi> 2. 23. to Repent, and be Baptized every one of
them in the Name of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> thereby to
obtain Remiſſion of Sins, and the Gift of the Holy
Ghoſt. And our <hi>Lord's</hi> appearing to St. <hi>Paul</hi> before
his Converſion, and then ordering him to addreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to <hi>Ananias</hi> (ſuppoſed to be the then Biſhop of
<hi>Damaſcus)</hi> to be told by him, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>what
he muſt do,</hi> Acts 9. 6. had been no leſs idle, than the
ſame Apoſtles preaching afterwards to others muſt alſo
have been. And ſo His words uttered, St. <hi>John</hi> 15. 5.
<hi>He that abideth in me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For without me ye can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
And St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the Jewiſh <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
a very groſs and palpable untruth, when to
their Faces he poſitively declared, that <hi>there was no
Salvation</hi> [to be obtained] <hi>but by Chriſt,</hi> if the ſame
were no leſs attainable, not only by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but by
<hi>Mahomet</hi> alſo, or any other proſperous Impoſtor in
<hi>Religion.</hi> And ſo likewiſe the Angel directing <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
to ſend for St. <hi>Peter, who when he was come, ſhould
tell him, what he M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ST DO,</hi> (the very ſame that was
by our <hi>Bleſſed</hi> Lord ſaid to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> I ſay, that this)
had been an evident <hi>Deluſion,</hi> ſeeing there was no
ſuch Neceſſity of Chriſtianity, as that imperſonal
<hi>[Muſt]</hi> doth import. And this of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> is a
moſt pregnant Argument (and in truth unanſwerable)
both for the neceſſity of Chriſtianity, and, I think
alſo, of the <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> Who, <hi>if ever any Perſon could,</hi>
might certainly no leſs have been ſaved without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
He being <hi>one that feared God with all his Houſe,</hi>
holding it in vain to be <hi>Pious himſelf,</hi> if he ſuffered his
Family to be wicked. He was, as his Character de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Religious and devout Worſhipper:
One that gave much Alms,</hi> and <hi>prayed to God always;</hi>
and at the <hi>30th verſe,</hi> we find him addicted to <hi>Faſting,</hi>
a duty practiſed only by <hi>devout</hi> Perſons: And for the
certainty thereof, this we find all of it atteſted from
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56561:62"/>
the Mouth of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and by the Meſſage and
Confeſſion of <hi>an holy Angel.</hi> But notwithſtanding
that <hi>his Prayers were heard, and his Alms had in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
in the ſight of God;</hi> yet the main thing, the
Knowledg of Chriſt being wanting, St. <hi>Peter</hi> (our
Lord reſolving <hi>to have his Work performed by its proper
Miniſters)</hi> muſt be ſent for (the Angel <hi>having no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Commiſſion)</hi> to inſtruct him in that moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Knowledge of Chriſt. And for the <hi>Negro's</hi> belief
of the <hi>Deity,</hi> St. <hi>Philip</hi>'s Preaching to the <hi>Eunuch</hi> by
the like eſpecial Mandate, ſhews that his former <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi>
was of it ſelf, and without this, <hi>inſufficient,</hi> tho
otherwiſe never ſo <hi>Pure, Simple,</hi> and <hi>Sincere.</hi> Nor
had there been any need thereof, if <hi>Reprobated</hi> and
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncapable,</hi> or naturally deſtitute of any Right thereto.
But that neither the <hi>Negro's</hi> ſimple Faith, nor other
Mens abundant <hi>Charity,</hi> nor yet the <hi>Jews</hi> Dreams of
their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come, can ſave any Man tho living
never ſo uprightly therein; our Bleſſed Lord's Anſwer
to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman, St. <hi>John 4. Ye worſhip ye
know not what, we know what we worſhip; for Salvation
is of the</hi> [true Church and Believers only, which are
the] <hi>Jews,</hi> doth to me fully prove. Wherefore I
ſhall be bold to conclude this Point, in the words of
the <hi>18th Article</hi> of our Church, in which we find it
declared; <q>That they are to be had Accurſed, that
preſume to ſay, that every Man ſhall be ſaved by
the <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Sect,</hi> which he profeſſeth: For that
holy Scripture doth ſet forth unto us only the <hi>Name
of Jeſus Chriſt, whereby Men muſt be ſaved.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>§. V. 1. Well, but if this will not do, they are
ſure that the next ſhall; wherein 'tis pretended, firſt,
<hi>That their Slaves are not hindred,</hi> for that they may be
Chriſtians if they will: Secondly, That granting they
were hindred, <hi>yet that it would be no Wrong nor Injuſtice
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56561:63"/>
to them,</hi> for that at the worſt, they could thereby be
but in the ſame condition here, in which they ſhould
have otherwiſe remained in their Native Country:
And laſtly, <hi>That they neither ſeek nor deſire it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. To which I anſwer, Firſt, That if it be true,
that they indeed do not hinder them from embracing
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> they have then the leſs guilt upon them,
and they are not to anſwer for ſo vile a Crime. Yet
will not this excuſe them, it being without doubt
<hi>their ſtricteſt Duty,</hi> not only, not to hinder them, but to
perſuade and win them to become <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> as I ſhall
more fully ſhew, when I come to anſwer their third
<hi>Allegation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. But ſecondly, As this Anſwer can no way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
them, ſo neither indeed is it <hi>ture:</hi> For to be
plain, I muſt poſitively affirm, that they are <hi>hindred,</hi>
and that more or leſs, theſe four ways.</p>
               <p>4. Firſt, By depriving them of <hi>Time,</hi> and denying
them Perſons to <hi>inſtruct</hi> them, and even impoſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them a neceſſity <hi>of planting Proviſion</hi> for their Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
even <hi>upon Sundays.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Secondly, By diſcouragements and <hi>ſcoffs,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling
into them a <hi>ſlight eſteem,</hi> with an opinion of the
<hi>no neceſſity of Religion, as to Slaves and Negro's.</hi> Which,
next a deſire of being Idle, (a Vice incident to our
own People) is the cauſe of their avoiding the Room
at Prayers (of which ſee <hi>P.</hi> 9.). Now <hi>Scoffing</hi> is term'd
a <hi>Perſecution,</hi> Gal. 4. 29. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 9.
Things <hi>in their proper Nature</hi> honourable, being apt
hereby to be rendred <hi>baſe and ridiculous.</hi> And ſuch a
<hi>Perſecution</hi> it is, as the moſt crafty Enemies of <hi>Religion,</hi>
did hold it for the moſt effectual way to deſtroy <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;</hi>
and as ſuch was formerly no leſs dreaded by <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
Nor can we blame the <hi>Negro's,</hi> if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which they hourly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56561:63"/>
both hear and ſee <hi>trampled</hi> upon, and <hi>undervalued</hi> by
themſelves.</p>
               <p>6. Thirdly, By direct force and puniſhment of the
<hi>Innocent</hi> Offenders therein, thereby to deter all others.
Which in truth hath ſtruck ſuch a <hi>dread</hi> into them,
that few have ſince had the <hi>Courage</hi> to make the leaſt
offer at it. And ſome, whilſt privately learning their
Prayers, dictated to them, have given ſuch manifeſt
<hi>Indications</hi> of their <hi>Fears,</hi> that, as if <hi>attempting ſome
Villany,</hi> upon the leaſt <hi>noiſe</hi> or <hi>ſtir,</hi> their <hi>Spirits</hi> have
failed them, and they have wanted Power to proceed,
but were forced to give off, till the Coaſt were clear,
and they found that they might attend with more
Security. And hereof 'tis eaſie to produce divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
if required.</p>
               <p>7. But there hath been a Force known to have been
uſed, beyond <hi>ill Looks, Frowns,</hi> or bare <hi>Words;</hi> which
'tis certain was once (and for ought I know oftner)
<hi>without any great diſcredit to the Author,</hi> eminently, and
<hi>in the face of the Sun,</hi> executed upon a poor Wretch,
offending in this kind. His Crime being neither more
nor leſs, than receiving <hi>Baptiſm</hi> upon a <hi>Sunday-Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
at his <hi>Pariſh-Church,</hi> from the Hands of the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
thereof; Who was ſaid afterwards to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
thus, <hi>That he could not deny it, being demanded
of him.</hi> But the <hi>Negro</hi> at his return, did not eſcape
ſo eaſily: The <hi>brutiſh</hi> Overſeer inſtantly taking him
to task, and giving him to underſtand, that that
was no <hi>Sunday-work for thoſe of his Complexion;</hi> that
he had other buſineſs for him, the neglect whereof
ſhould coſt him an <hi>Afternoons baptiſm in Blood</hi> (thoſe
I heard were his very words) as in <hi>the Morning he had
received a baptiſm with Water;</hi> which he accordingly
made good. Of which the <hi>Negro</hi> afterward complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ſame <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and he to the then <hi>Governor,</hi>
the miſerable Wretch was for ever after ſo unmercifully
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56561:64"/>
treated by that inhumane <hi>Devil,</hi> that <hi>to avoid his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,</hi>
betaking himſelf to the Woods, <hi>he there periſhed.</hi>
An act exceeding all the Examples of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and ſcarce to be parallel'd amongſt the <hi>Immanities</hi>
of the moſt <hi>ſavage</hi> Creatures; who rarely (if ever)
are known (unprovoked) to fall foul of, and to
worry and deſtroy thoſe of their <hi>own</hi> kind; but
contrarily, to defend them againſt the <hi>violence</hi>
of otherlike, but different, <hi>Beaſts of Prey.</hi> The
villanous <hi>Author</hi> whereof deſerved, beyond the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
inflicted on <hi>the perfidious Pedant of Falerii,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by <hi>Livie, lib.</hi> 5. to have been <hi>whipt to Death</hi> by
the reſidue of his Slaves. Which notwithſtanding he
has eſcaped, yet let him know, that <hi>Divine Vengeance,
tho it be ſlow, is ſure;</hi> and that without a ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
attended with ſtrong endeavours <hi>to repair
this Injury</hi> by him done to <hi>God</hi> and to <hi>Religion,</hi> there is
a fearful Puniſhment reſerved for him; A <hi>Baptiſm</hi> alſo,
not of Water, (or Blood only), but <hi>in the Lake that
burns with Fire and Brimſtone.</hi> Nor here let any one
by reaſon of the <hi>horridneſs of this Fact,</hi> ſtraightway
therefore diſcredit the <hi>Relation,</hi> as impoſſible to be
acted <hi>amongſt Chriſtians;</hi> the Story being riſe in all
Mens Knowledg and Diſcourſe, that <hi>care to remember,</hi>
or take <hi>notice</hi> of it; and thoſe that do not, <hi>being [here]
unable to deny it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Fourthly, They are hindred by <hi>muzzling Their
Mouths,</hi> who ſhould acquaint them therewith, and by
rendring the Work very unſafe, even to the <hi>Guides of
Souls,</hi> and <hi>Miniſters of Religion,</hi> which that <hi>Quaker's
Harangue,</hi> recited in the Introduction to this Diſcourſe,
as alſo the <hi>Miniſter's</hi> crude <hi>Apologie</hi> and <hi>Excuſe,</hi> (who
<hi>Baptized</hi> that <hi>perſecuted</hi> and even <hi>Martyred Negro,</hi> I but
now ſpoke of,) do enough imply. Who had he not
been an <hi>Eſtated</hi> Perſon (a happineſs now not attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
and no leſs ſtrongly fortified with great <hi>Friends</hi> and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56561:64"/>
                  <hi>Relations,</hi> and withal an Ancient <hi>Stander</hi> (tho ſince
fallen), he had for this been undoubtedly Ruin'd.
And I am verily perſuaded, that none here beſides <hi>durſt</hi>
to have done the ſame: Nor, <hi>I am confident,</hi> would he
himſelf have had the <hi>Courage</hi> to have <hi>committed</hi> the like
Act again upon any other; as by an <hi>Inſtance,</hi> wherein
he was ſince concerned, I ſhall immediately <hi>ſhew.</hi> So
that if our <hi>Negro's,</hi> who never underſtood either the
<hi>Benefit</hi> or <hi>Neceſſity</hi> thereof (theſe being things carefully
kept from their knowledg), in contempt of <hi>Scoffs</hi>
and Diſcouragements, their want of <hi>Leiſure</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi>
and in deſpite of the Overſeers <hi>Rods,</hi> ſhall
notwithſtanding all theſe have a ſtomach to be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
(without thanks to us) they may be ſo when
ſoever they will; all theſe being reputed no <hi>Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
thereto.</p>
               <p>9. To this I ſhall add the Barbarous Uſage of the
<hi>Preacher</hi> before mentioned, together with the <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
and <hi>ſpiteful</hi> Reproaches, wherewith they perſued
him even to thoſe places whither he retired to avoid
their <hi>Inſolencies;</hi> of which 'tis certain, his <hi>Sermon</hi> (a
part whereof, partly for his <hi>Vindication,</hi> and partly to
let the World ſee what kind of <hi>Doctrine</hi> it is they here
much <hi>Nauſeate,</hi> I have here Tranſcribed) was the
chief, if not the ſole occaſion. Nor ſhall I omit
that when <hi>another</hi> had in diſcourſe propoſed ſomething
tending hereto; his Propoſal was ſo maliciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
amongſt the <hi>Rabble,</hi> that he told me, <hi>he was
endangered thereby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. The ſence whereof did ſo much work upon
one, whom alſo for his <hi>character</hi> I Pity, that he durſt
not give Chriſtian Burial to a <hi>Mulatto</hi> Child born in
his Houſe, and by himſelf privately <hi>(tho not without
importunity) Baptized:</hi> The Father being of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
Nation, and the Mother his Domeſtic Slave. For
which reaſon ſhe muſt be unmarried <hi>(tho Baptiz<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d);</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:56561:65"/>
leſt the Husband ſhould thereby be <hi>inveſted</hi> with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
in her, and ſhe ſhould become no longer his;
who was therefore compelled <hi>to live in Fornication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. For which cauſe alſo, when a certain <hi>good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured</hi>
wealthy Perſon (and this is the Inſtance I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed)
did <hi>upon his death-bed,</hi> make a Teſtamentary
Alotment of ſome Weekly exceedings for Diet to ſix
<hi>Negro's,</hi> during their Lives, in requital of their Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and good Services to him; two <hi>Miniſters</hi> (who
ſucceſſively came to viſit him, and for whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
a particular kindneſs) being (in my hearing)
preſſed ſeverally as they came, <hi>to make uſe of the</hi> oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
<hi>and to try whether in that good Humour he might
not be further wrought upon, ſo as to perfect and compleat
his</hi> Charity, <hi>by a more neceſſary</hi> proviſion <hi>for their Souls,
and perſuading him to give</hi> order <hi>likewiſe for the inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and</hi> baptizing <hi>of</hi> thoſe ſix Negro's; It was ſtrange
to obſerve how they were ſtartled at this ſo unexpected
motion; each of them giving manifeſt Indications of
his inward Grief, but replying, <hi>That as ſuch</hi> Propoſals
<hi>were altegether</hi> new <hi>and</hi> without precedent (O turpem
notam temporum!) <hi>ſo they thought it neither ſeaſonable
nor</hi> ſafe <hi>at that time</hi> quieta movere, <hi>nor to cauſe diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
by ſuch an</hi> Innovation. <hi>Neither did they judge it
prudence thereby to</hi> diſoblige <hi>their</hi> Friends, <hi>whereof they
had not many in the</hi> Iſland, <hi>and to</hi> exaſperate <hi>their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
And being withal ſenſible what it was</hi> to periſh
unpitied and unregarded; <hi>and no leſs certain (even at
the beſt, and ſuppoſing they ſhould have the luck to eſcape a</hi>
grave <hi>and inſignificant</hi> Rebuke <hi>for their</hi> indiſcreet Zeal)
<hi>to be upon their greateſt Sufferings, referred for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
to another World, <hi>but never to hope for either</hi> pity
or compaſſion <hi>from any in this.</hi> And here we may
reade the evil conſequence of making <hi>Miniſters Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Stipendiaries,</hi> and of ſubjecting them to the <hi>Arbitrary
Talons</hi> of <hi>Veſteries,</hi> made up for the moſt part of ſordid
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56561:65"/>
Plebeians, the very Dregs of the <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> with
whom to be truly <hi>Conſcientious,</hi> is the height of <hi>mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
and folly; and whoſe diſpleaſure, even of any one
of them, tho in the moſt Righteous Cauſe, doth por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the parties <hi>moſt certain Ruine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. AND ſo much for their firſt <hi>Allegation:</hi> Now
to the ſecond I anſwer: Firſt, That they are not ſure
but that by other ways, their <hi>Negro's</hi> Chriſtianity
might have been brought about, even in their own
<hi>Native</hi> Country; where on the one hand there is a
<hi>freedom</hi> and liberty of perſuading, and of <hi>attending</hi>
thereto on the other; Advantages hardly to be met
with, or to be <hi>expected</hi> here.</p>
               <p>13. For, firſt, It is not impoſſible but that ſome of
thoſe, whom we here do uſually reproach for <hi>Madmen,
('tis happy for St</hi> Paul <hi>that he is dead;</hi> for his very Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
would now not ſtick to affirm him <hi>beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:)</hi>
might in imitation of the firſt <hi>Diſciples,</hi> be (like
them) poſſeſſed with <hi>ardent</hi> deſires to enlarge the <hi>Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories</hi>
of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and charitably to undertake Voyages
thither for the <hi>good of Souls.</hi> Or that ſome of thoſe
more ſober and <hi>wiſer</hi> Men, who travel for Preferment,
and Wealth, might by ſome chance or other be invited
thither as divers are: Where 'tis poſſible, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the <hi>WO to the unprofitable Servant,</hi> and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo much occaſion and need in thoſe parts for the
<hi>imployment</hi> of their <hi>Talents,</hi> (with which <hi>God had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
them);</hi>
they might in time bethink themſelves,
and laying aſide (in ſome meaſure) the <hi>ſtudy of the
World,</hi> might more carefully addict themſelves to that
true <hi>Labour</hi> for which they were appointed and <hi>called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
Or, which one would think leſs unlikely; our <hi>zealous
Nonconformiſts,</hi> ſtruck with thoſe <hi>Terrours</hi> which they
give out, for the reaſon of their thwarting the <hi>Law</hi>
at Home (where there is <hi>no want of their Labours)</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:56561:66"/>
conſidering the much greater <hi>Harveſt</hi> in thoſe parts,
might have reſorted <hi>thither,</hi> thereby to have convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the World, that their pretences were <hi>real:</hi> and
that the gaining of <hi>Souls</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not the draining
of their <hi>Proſelytes</hi> Purſes, and living in eaſe and <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi>
in the Wealthier Places <hi>only,</hi> was indeed their great
and mighty <hi>Aim,</hi> both in their <hi>Preaching,</hi> and other
Actions of their Life: And there being in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
both Liberty, (void of <hi>Perſecuting</hi> Laws and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
and free from the <hi>Impoſitions</hi> of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies)</hi>
and Occaſion enough for even <hi>thouſands</hi> of
them. Beſides, they ſhould, like <hi>the Sons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
conſider that <hi>their place where they dwell, is too
ſtraight for them;</hi> and repleniſhed with others more ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Government, whereas elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
there is no <hi>Confinement</hi> to ſuch Inconveniencies.
And this alſo would be a <hi>noble imitation</hi> of thoſe firſt
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who when <hi>Perſecuted in Judea,</hi> fled into
other parts, and there preached the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Or
fourthly, Some <hi>Roman</hi> Votaries, (they being of <hi>thoſe
that ſow beſides all Waters)</hi> might out of their <hi>Annual
Miſſions,</hi> be allotted for thoſe Quarters, and for ought
we know are now preaching to their <hi>Relations;</hi> whoſe
condition as to <hi>Religion</hi> cannot be worſe; ſomething <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered</hi>
it certainly may be, tho perchance not <hi>comparable
to what it ought.</hi> And in all theſe caſes, 'twere hard
if after ſo <hi>much Toil,</hi> their <hi>Nets</hi> ſhould ſtill be returned
<hi>emptied.</hi> Eſpecially where thoſe irreſiſtable impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the growth of Religion, the <hi>ſcoffs</hi> and flirts
of our <hi>Witty Brutes</hi> and Atheiſts, do not interpoſe to
afright the more timerous and wary <hi>Frye,</hi> and to <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Draught.</hi> Laſtly, Some <hi>poor Captive,</hi> like the
Woman carried into <hi>Iberia,</hi> or as <hi>Frumentius</hi> and <hi>Aede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi>
ſtrangers accidentally arriving there, might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily,
by Divine Providence, have been the <hi>Authors</hi> of
their converſion to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Nothing <hi>in all this</hi> being
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56561:66"/>
                  <hi>impoſſible.</hi> And therefore they ſeem to Diſcourſe at
random, and without aim, who affirm that our <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro's,</hi>
tho here continued in their firſt ſtate of <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſm,</hi>
are yet in no worſe condition, than they ſhould
have been in <hi>Africa;</hi> and that therefore no wrong is
done them. Indeed, had they been Tranſported hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and here made <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> tho they had payed
no leſs than their Liberty and <hi>Quiet,</hi> for the kindneſs,
(to which they are forced <hi>without it,)</hi> I am perſuaded
they had ſpoken nearer to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>14. NOR will their third <hi>Allegation,</hi> that <hi>they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſire nor ſeek after it,</hi> (to which, ſhould they go
about it, they ſhould be ſure to receive that reply,
which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> made to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> upon the like
ſuit, <hi>Exod. 5. 17. Ye are idle,</hi> &amp;c.) any more excuſe
them, than the two former. It being a <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
ſtricteſt duty, by his being ſuch, to perſuade and <hi>invite</hi>
unbelievers and wicked Men, tho of a more diſtant
and remote <hi>Relation</hi> to us, than our Slaves are, <hi>to ſerve
God,</hi> and to embrace that Faith and <hi>Religion,</hi> by which
himſelf doth hope to be ſaved, and without which he
knows the other cannot. But if the parties be ſuch,
as over whom he hath a <hi>juſt</hi> Authority, I there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it his Duty, if poſſible to <hi>compel them to it;</hi>
I mean by all fair and laudable means: As both
the Parable of the <hi>Supper,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. and <hi>Joſias</hi>'s
compelling <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>ſerve the Lord,</hi> do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
prove. And therefore the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> in the
Bible, tho their Servants ſought it not (poſſibly)
any more than theſe, yet by their own Authority they
initiated them into Religion. Hence <hi>Abraham</hi> whoſe
honour it was, <hi>That he would command</hi> (and that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is Compulſion) <hi>his Children and his Houſhold,
after him to keep the Way of the Lord,</hi> (and <hi>in the ſteps
of whoſe Faith each Chriſtian ought to walk,</hi> Rom. 4. 12.)
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56561:67"/>
is intimated to have <hi>Inſtructed and Catechized</hi> thoſe
three hundred and eighteen, whom he led forth to
<hi>reſcue his Couſin Lot:</hi> As may be ſeen by comparing
<hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 14. with <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 6. and their ſeveral Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.
And what he began, his Poſterity continued,
whoſe <hi>Slaves</hi> were not only <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> but alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the <hi>Paſſover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which laſt were both by <hi>ſpecial
Command,</hi> whilſt the other were purely <hi>voluntary;</hi> yet
commended, as <hi>being alſo their Duty</hi> even by the <hi>Law
of Nature,</hi> and that Principle of doing good, ſo far
as we are able, implanted in our Hearts. So alſo
<hi>Joſhua</hi> reſolved, That <hi>his Houſhold ſhould ſerve the Lord,</hi>
as well <hi>as himſelf.</hi> And <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 101. purpoſed
to retain none but <hi>faithful</hi> Perſons to <hi>dwell in his
Houſe.</hi> And <hi>Cornelius,</hi> even before his converſion,
or knowledg of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is ſaid to <hi>fear God with all his
Houſe.</hi> Without which, I fear, he had miſſed the
character of being a <hi>devout Man.</hi> And it is no leſs
evident, that in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the Faithful held it their
<hi>Duty,</hi> even by virtue of their <hi>Calling and Profeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to
<hi>Chriſtianize</hi> their Servants. Every ſuch (even as
Children and Subjects, are to Parents and Magiſtrates)
being as it were ſo many Limbs and Members of their
<hi>Maſters</hi> and <hi>Owners,</hi> and in ſome ſort the ſame to them
as their <hi>Children,</hi> and no leſs accountable both to <hi>God</hi>
and Man for them. From whence it may ſeem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That
the ſame word in the three <hi>learned Languages,</hi> is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
uſed to expreſs both a <hi>Servant</hi> and a <hi>Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to
Intimate that ſtrict care which each Father and Maſter
had, and ought ſtill to uſe for the preſervation, and
due proviſion for them, both as to Soul and Body,
and for their <hi>Spiritual</hi> as well as <hi>Temporal</hi> Food. And
for all others it is <hi>Charity,</hi> if not <hi>Duty,</hi> to keep Men
<hi>out of Miſery and Ruine,</hi> even againſt their <hi>Wills.</hi> And
tho they be inſenſible of it, ſhould they therefore be
<hi>allowed</hi> to periſh, our ſelves beholding it, and not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56561:67"/>
                  <hi>adviſing</hi> them of the <hi>danger?</hi> Should a <hi>Phyſician</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
his <hi>Patient</hi> to ſtarve himſelf, becauſe he hath loſt
his <hi>Appetite</hi> through the viciouſneſs of his <hi>Stomach,</hi> or
over-long <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Abſtinence,</hi> and not be accounted
<hi>(tho he eſcape being indited)</hi> for a <hi>Murtherer?</hi> 'Tis true,
if after <hi>due</hi> proviſion made and tendered, he <hi>rejects</hi> it,
and periſheth in that obſtinate <hi>refuſal,</hi> after all due
Means and Arguments uſed to <hi>convince</hi> him, then we
may ſay to him, <hi>Perditio ex te ipſo,</hi> and the whole
<hi>guilt</hi> of his deſtruction will lie <hi>at his own door.</hi> And
therefore admitting it to be no wrong to the <hi>Negro's</hi> in
not making them <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and that, what is before
affirmed, they were of no probability of attaining to
the knowledg of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>Guinea,</hi> which alſo is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural,
and <hi>but a mean commendation of the Traders</hi>
thither, <hi>(who,</hi> I have heard, <hi>are by Bond always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to the contrary);</hi> yet certainly we herein wrong
our ſelves, by neglecting our <hi>Duty</hi> in ſo high a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
whilſt inſtead of performing <hi>faithful ſervice to
Chriſt, to whom we have vowed our whole Man,</hi> we in
the mean time are found to ſerve the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
only. For, as the Orator teſtifies, that Perſon
may juſtly be reputed an acceſſary to a Miſchief, which
<hi>he might,</hi> but did not <hi>prevent:</hi> Agreable to that of
St. <hi>James</hi> 4. and the laſt <hi>ver. To him that knoweth to do
good, and doth it not, to him it is Sin.</hi> And if Sins of
<hi>Omiſſion</hi> be by ſome accounted greater than thoſe that
are <hi>acted</hi> or done, there is no doubt but that he who
<hi>wounds his Soul</hi> by omitting his <hi>Duty,</hi> injures and hurts
himſelf equally with him that commits a <hi>Villany.</hi> Nor
ſhall I be afraid to affirm, that if this I am ſpeaking
of, touching our <hi>Negro's Chriſtianity</hi> being hindred
(or at leaſt neglected) be no Sin, then neither is <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
Murther,</hi> nor <hi>Adultery.</hi> And they, who, being
<hi>concerned</hi> herein, do hold themſelves innocent, may as
ſafely preſume that <hi>that our Saviour Chriſt, to promote
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56561:68"/>
their Gain, will diſpenſe with the moſt palpable</hi> violation
<hi>of all his Laws.</hi> For <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is a <hi>Religion of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
which teacheth us <hi>to be Eyes to the Blind, Ears to
the Deaf, Feet to the Lame,</hi> and calls upon us <hi>to open
our Mouths for the Dumb,</hi> and <hi>which cannot Speak</hi> in their
own cauſe. And it was <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s advice to <hi>ſell all and
give to the Poor,</hi> for the furtherance of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> And
if the Primitive Chriſtians did from thence conceive
themſelves obliged to diſpoſe of their <hi>whole Eſtates</hi> for
the ſupport of <hi>poor Believers,</hi> and the <hi>encreaſe</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> doubtleſs they were far from any <hi>deduction</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from that, or from any other <hi>Text,</hi> for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
it <hi>for their private Gain.</hi> Now 'tis all one
<hi>to forego our Profit</hi> for the ſame <hi>good End,</hi> as thus to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe
of it when <hi>acquired.</hi> And that Piety is no leſs
acceptable, which is the means of <hi>introducing new Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi>
than of <hi>preſerving</hi> the old. Nor is its worth
at all <hi>leſſened</hi> by the <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>Parties</hi> won and
brought over to the <hi>Faith;</hi> one <hi>Soul</hi> being as precious
and dear to <hi>God</hi> as another, and a Slaves, being in his
ſight not inferiour to his <hi>Maſters.</hi> And where the
conſideration of the <hi>End,</hi> namely, <hi>the good of Souls,</hi>
is the ſame, the excellency of the <hi>Duty</hi> cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
by any <hi>leſs worthy</hi> intervening Circumſtances.
And this is to be underſtood as relating to the care
we ought to uſe for the <hi>Salvation</hi> of Strangers, living
at the <hi>remoteſt</hi> diſtance, and without <hi>relation</hi> to us.
But here is no ſuch <hi>plea</hi> or pretence; tho it would be
but of ſmall <hi>force.</hi> The parties we ſpeak of being their
<hi>Servants,</hi> and even branches of <hi>each Family,</hi> by whom
they in a manner wholly ſubſiſt; <hi>(ſome,</hi> and thoſe not
a few, <hi>having by their Negro's labour</hi> arrived to vaſt
Riches) and <hi>for whoſe Souls they are as certainly account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God,</hi> as for <hi>their own.</hi> Who therefore cannot
but claim a <hi>ſhare</hi> equal with themſelves, in all things
abſolutely neceſſary for their life and being, and the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56561:68"/>
enabling them to perform <hi>whatſoever</hi> is by God or Man

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Inconveniencies here pretended for this
Neglect being examined, will be found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſuch, but rather the contrary.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. I. n. 1. THe <hi>abſolute</hi> neceſſity of a <hi>Chriſtian's</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> even in deſpite
of the greateſt Difficulties and Inconveniencies being
ſhewed, I come now in the laſt place to examin thoſe
very <hi>Inconveniencies,</hi> and to try whether they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſuch, as they are <hi>pretended;</hi> or whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of thoſe practices for whoſe <hi>Juſtification</hi> this
Plea was invented, will not upon a due trial be found
more <hi>inconvenient</hi> and prejudicial to our <hi>Intereſt:</hi> At
leaſt whether <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> notwithſtanding theſe <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi>
(whether true or falſe) may not, upon the
ſcore of its <hi>innocent</hi> deportment, and unqueſtionable
<hi>blameleſsneſs</hi> in all Ages, without the leaſt hazard to
any Man's <hi>juſt Right and Intereſt,</hi> be afforded a free
courſe, and find entertainment amongſt <hi>all</hi> Conditions
and Degrees without <hi>prejudice,</hi> or <hi>offence</hi> to any.</p>
               <p>2. And here I ſhall not <hi>conceal,</hi> what I have often
within my own Breſt <hi>conſidered</hi> and <hi>wondered</hi> at; how,
and with what <hi>Front</hi> theſe Perſons who proclaim to
the World, the <hi>inconveniencies</hi> and dangers threatned
by <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to their <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi> (for <hi>no leſs are
the things in controverſie)</hi> can utter things which I am
certain themſelves neither do, nor can, <hi>believe:</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impoſſible but that Men endued with <hi>common ſence</hi>
muſt know (and that with the <hi>higheſt certainty</hi> that
they can have), that nothing of prejudice can <hi>really</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:56561:69"/>
accrue to any Man by the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> But much
leſs can they be imagined ever to have entertained
any thoughts touching a <hi>future Account</hi> to be given for
ſuch <hi>blaſphemous ſuggeſtions,</hi> which to the diſhonour of
their <hi>bleſſed Redeemer,</hi> and his <hi>Eternal Truth,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
belch forth <hi>without the leaſt ſhame</hi> or <hi>bluſh.</hi> For
otherwiſe Chriſtianity might doubtleſs have found
more <hi>candid</hi> and <hi>civil uſage</hi> from them, than to have
thus put upon her ſuch an <hi>hideous</hi> and <hi>frightful</hi> Dreſs,
as theſe have taken the <hi>boldneſs</hi> to repreſent her in, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the more ignorant and beſotted <hi>Herd</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi>
in theſe <hi>remote</hi> Quarters of the World.</p>
               <p>3. For it cannot but appear evident, even to the
dimmeſt and moſt bleared <hi>ſight,</hi> that no ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<hi>danger</hi> can poſſibly attend the <hi>Work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I am here
<hi>ſuing</hi> for, on our <hi>Slaves</hi> Behalf; there being no perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
<hi>Magiſtrates</hi> carrying in their Breſts an <hi>hoſtile
Enmity</hi> againſt either the <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> or <hi>Promoters</hi> of it;
nor yet breathing out <hi>ſlaughter</hi> and <hi>deſtruction</hi> to them.
There are no Confiſcations of <hi>Eſtates</hi> or <hi>Goods;</hi> no
loſs of <hi>Liberty</hi> threatned; nor is it a <hi>Crime</hi> now to be
a Chriſtian; the <hi>Civil Powers</hi> being ſuch themſelves, and
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> being long ſince become <hi>Patrons</hi> and
<hi>Nurſes</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 Yet notwithſtanding this, they are not aſhamed
to infer ('tis true, not always in expreſs words,
as I have ſaid) even as great <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> from their
<hi>Negro-Slaves</hi> becoming Chriſtians (but not otherwiſe)
as the <hi>Faithful</hi> in the Primitive Times ſuſtained from
the moſt perſecuting <hi>Heathens.</hi> It being their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Affirmation,</hi> That the <hi>Baptizing</hi> of their <hi>Negro's,
is the ready way to have all their Throats cut,</hi> &amp;c. which
my ſelf, and I believe thouſands of others have heard
declared and inſiſted upon by them, with <hi>much vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menoy</hi>
and <hi>indignation;</hi> tho without any great ſhew
of <hi>Reaſon</hi> to make it out. For being at any time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56561:70"/>
from whence thoſe <hi>fears</hi> could ariſe, they
ſhould never fail moſt perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly
to <hi>perſiſt</hi> in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>So</hi> Turtullian <hi>ſaith of the Gentiles,</hi> Nolentes audire, quod auditum damnare non poſſint. <hi>Apol. c.</hi> 1.</note>
                  <hi>That it was ſo.</hi>
Which, with the addition of
a few <hi>angry</hi> words, and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil
rude ſpeeches,</hi> in reply to thoſe demands, thereby
to teſtifie their diſpleaſure thereat, as well as the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of enquiring further into their <hi>ſecrets,</hi> was what
was uſuall to be <hi>gotten</hi> from them.</p>
               <p>5. But that which I have caſually learned from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Falſe-Brothers</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> hath in their more
retired <hi>Cabals,</hi> been alledged by them (and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>was no other</hi> than what I before <hi>ſuſpected)</hi> was
principally theſe three things.</p>
               <p>6. Firſt, They object the <hi>Knowledg wherewith their
Slaves would be thereby furniſhed;</hi> which they are ſure
will make them leſs governable, and like the <hi>Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
of old, or our <hi>ſeditious Reformers</hi> in 1642. to <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny</hi>
and <hi>rebel,</hi> to free themſelves from <hi>Tyranny</hi> and
<hi>Oppreſſion:</hi> Poſſeſs them with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> (of whom
here are great numbers) and other <hi>Phanatic's ſpirit
of Obſtinacy,</hi> againſt all Laws and Government, and
<hi>diſpoſe them rather to ſuffer Death</hi> than <hi>to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſubject,</hi> and
at laſt <hi>out of pure Conſcience, to murther their Maſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Secondly, They object <hi>the charge</hi> and <hi>loſs of Time,</hi>
viz. <hi>from their Sunday-work,</hi> &amp;c. with divers other
the like <hi>ſore Inconveniencies,</hi> which in the end will
(forſooth) ſtrike <hi>deep at their Profit,</hi> and quite ruine
their <hi>Eſtates.</hi> And therefore they often repeat this
ſaying, <hi>If the</hi> Negro's <hi>get to be Baptized,</hi> they <hi>muſt then
e'ne take the</hi> Iſland <hi>to themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Thirdly, They complain that the <hi>Terms of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
are in ſome things too large,</hi> but <hi>in ſome other too
narrow for them;</hi> both ways inconſiſtent with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Bondage: And therefore that their <hi>Negro's</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:56561:70"/>
are not to be admitted to, nor entruſted therewith.
In which three we have a brief <hi>Account</hi> of both the
Principles and Men, that are ſuch fierce Enemies to
this way of propagating <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> Their <hi>Religion</hi>
and <hi>Intereſt</hi> are of one and the ſame piece, nor <hi>are they
aſhamed to own it to the World.</hi> Doubtleſs, theſe do
conclude the <hi>Merchant</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> who judged it
worth his while <hi>to ſell all that he had</hi> beſides, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
<hi>that Pearl,</hi> to have had but a very ſhallow Pate,
for <hi>ſetting ſuch a high</hi> value upon <hi>nothing,</hi> or at moſt, but
<hi>Toys</hi> and <hi>Fooleries,</hi> whoſe worth they believe lies only
in the <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>opinion</hi> of the Wearer, not in any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic
excellency of their own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. But to undeceive the more well diſpoſed, and
to defeat their Malice by unfolding this <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Anti-Religioniſm:</hi>
I ſhall in anſwer to their firſt <hi>Objection,</hi>
here demand of them, of what kind that <hi>Knowledg</hi> is
they ſtand ſo much in fear of? Is it the knowledg of
<hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs?</hi> Certainly it cannot be other
which Chriſtianity inſtructs Men in. And how can
there ariſe any <hi>danger</hi> from ſuch knowledg ſhould they
receive in never ſo great a proportiou? Can the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
Creed,</hi> and <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> with ſome few <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſtical</hi>
and general Points of the more neceſſary parts
of Chriſtianity from thence deduced, prove ſo poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous
to the minds of Men, as to make them deſerve
a Character due only to the vileſt <hi>Blood-ſuckers,</hi> and
cruel <hi>Aſſaſſins?</hi> Or can <hi>theſe</hi> be a means to render them
<hi>ſuſpected,</hi> or <hi>dangerous to the World,</hi> when 'tis known
that nothing but the <hi>non-obſervance of them,</hi> is the ſole
<hi>occaſion of all,</hi> as well the greateſt as the leaſt <hi>evils?</hi>
And therefore the <hi>Slaves</hi> Right underſtanding and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
in theſe <hi>Doctrines,</hi> can no more be a motive
to him to <hi>ſlacken his Duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or prejudice his <hi>Maſter,</hi> than
an <hi>Artizan</hi>'s known skill in his Trade can unqualifie
him for being imployed therein, or his tried <hi>Honeſty,</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:56561:71"/>
from being either truſted or dealt with. This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
therefore muſt in common Reaſon, he concluded
to be the <hi>Maſter's</hi> chiefeſt <hi>Intereſt,</hi> being indeed a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
inducement to the <hi>higheſt truſt and confidence</hi> in his
<hi>Servant,</hi> thus endued therewith, and no leſs ought to
be his <hi>firſt care;</hi> That is, to make him <hi>Juſt, True,</hi>
and <hi>Honeſt</hi> to himſelf. At leaſt, none can reaſonably
be the more ſuſpected for addicting themſelves <hi>to ſuch
a Study,</hi> which only directs to <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi>
Where though they may be thought to begin <hi>but in
Jeſt,</hi> yet 'tis probable, they may <hi>end in Earneſt:</hi> Their
Reaſon may be overcome by the force of its <hi>Arguments,</hi>
or elſe their ſight may be captivated: For, <hi>Vidit hanc,

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> cupit,</hi> doth here very often follow; the <hi>tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
underſtanding of Vertue</hi> (as <hi>Plato</hi> obſerved) <hi>being
apt to create moſt ardent affections to it.</hi> Not can any
<hi>genuine,</hi> or <hi>true principle</hi> of Chriſtianity, give the leaſt
occaſion for either <hi>Fears</hi> or <hi>Jealouſies,</hi> becauſe in their
own proper nature <hi>the moſt innocent and oppoſite to all
Frauds, guileful Practices, and worldly Policies; of any
Religion ever yet profeſſed or taught.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Crafts</hi> and
<hi>Circumventions,</hi> which the generality of Men <hi>do not once
ſcruple,</hi> being moſt loathſom to the Mind of a true
Chriſtian. And therefore it is moſt evident, that no
Maſter can be endangered by his <hi>Slaves</hi> inſtruction
therein, which theſe <hi>Blaſphemers,</hi> who affirm the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
cannot but <hi>know;</hi> unleſs we will ſuppoſe them
like <hi>Owls</hi> and <hi>Bats,</hi> to be ſtark blind in the cleareſt
<hi>Meridion</hi> light; and that amidſt all the <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
with which this <hi>latter Age</hi> hath been ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ſtored, any Man can poſſibly ſtill remain ſo
<hi>ignorant,</hi> (tho <hi>ſubtile enough as to other leſs commendable</hi>
and <hi>excellent</hi> things) as to be utterly unacquainted,
with the firſt and greateſt points of his <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. But here withal, I muſt confeſs, that I am not
of their mind, who hold none fit to be admitted for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56561:71"/>
Chriſtians and <hi>Members of the Church,</hi> but Gifted, Wiſe
People only. Such as are able to <hi>Extemporize</hi> an hour
or two, and <hi>ſpeak to a Text,</hi> as they call it. This
poſſibly, as being of that <hi>kind of Knowledg or Science</hi>
which may be apt to <hi>puff them up,</hi> might in its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
prove fatal: It being not to be wondred at, if
their ſwelling Tympany of <hi>fancied Abilities</hi> do make
them preſume, ſince we read that when <hi>Hagar,</hi> (a
Bond-Woman too) <hi>had conceived,</hi> ſhe ſoon began to
behave her ſelf impudently <hi>towards her Miſtreſs.</hi> The
knowledg therefore which I here plead for, <hi>is ſuch as
tends to their Edification only,</hi> being of things <hi>abſolutely</hi>
neceſſary, as of <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> and of the
<hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> of <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and of
<hi>Repentance,</hi> of living <hi>uprightly,</hi> and of a conſcientious
diſcharge of their Duty <hi>both to God and Man.</hi> And
if theſe can be <hi>hurtful,</hi> then I ſhall not be aſhamed
even with the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> to confeſs, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of <hi>Chriſt's Religion,</hi> is a thing Repugnant, and
Inconſiſtent with the moſt <hi>honeſt</hi> and juſt <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and
wholly tending to <hi>diſturb the good Order and Peace of
the World.</hi> And yet here I would not be miſconſtrued,
as if intending to <hi>abridg</hi> any Maſters <hi>kindneſs</hi> to his
<hi>Slave,</hi> who hath a deſire to furniſh him with greater
knowledg: Only my requeſt is, <hi>That he would not damn
him for the want of this;</hi> which as I am ſure it is <hi>ſufficient
to ſave him,</hi> ſo neither is it <hi>conſiderable enough,</hi> for <hi>his
Maſters fears.</hi> And ſo much touching this <hi>firſt</hi> Point,
viz. <hi>The danger ariſing from the</hi> Negro's <hi>knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. The ſecond is an Implication of the fouleſt
charge againſt <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which the worſt Enemies
of it did ever ſuggeſt, but could never prove, <hi>viz.
That it inſtigates Men to Mutiny and Rebellion:</hi> Which
cannot poſſibly be true of it, but by <hi>Principles directing
thereunto,</hi> therein contained and taught. Which if ſo,
then 'twere impoſſible for a Chriſtian not to be a <hi>Rebel;</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:56561:72"/>
and the better <hi>Chriſtian the more Rebellious.</hi> But unto
ſuch <hi>Practices</hi> nothing is more diametrically oppoſite,
than the genuine Doctrines of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. For firſt, It preſſeth <hi>abſolute</hi> and entire <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
to <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Superiours,</hi> as may be collected from
almoſt innumerable places of Scripture; but more
eſpecially from the <hi>13th</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and from St.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s and St. <hi>Judes Epiſtles.</hi> And our Lord's anſwer
to the <hi>Herodians,</hi> is ſufficient to ſilence all Cavillation
touching this Duty. It gives the Title of <hi>Gods</hi> to
<hi>Kings</hi> and Magiſtrates, forbidding ſo much as to <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
evil of them.</hi> And this is ſo plainly and evidently
true, that amongſt <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Commonwealths-Men,
(two Names for one and the ſame thing)</hi> it is the only
Crime known to be by them charged with, <hi>viz.
That it inveſts Governours and Monarchs with ſo indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and abſolute a Power.</hi> And thereupon <hi>have for
divers Years paſt,</hi> wiſely endeavoured the <hi>ſuppreſſion of
it,</hi> to prevent (what they are pleaſed to term) <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi>
and <hi>Slavery,</hi> and in order to the <hi>advancing the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. Secondly, It eſtabliſheth the <hi>Authority of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi>
over their Servants and Slaves, in as high a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
as even themſelves could have preſcribed; in a
a due proportion placing them in a no leſs <hi>abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Power,</hi> than the former. Exacting the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<hi>Fidelity;</hi> and that without any reſpect to their
<hi>Quality and Condition,</hi> but of their <hi>natural and true
Right of Authority over them.</hi> Requiring ſervice <hi>with
ſingleneſs of heart, as unto the Lord, and not unto Men,</hi>
Epheſ. 6. 5, 7. And ſo far it is from encouraging
Reſiſtance, that it allows them not the <hi>liberty of Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying,</hi>
or making undutiful replys to their Maſters.
And referring them to <hi>future recompence in Heaven,</hi> for
their <hi>faithful ſervices done to them upon Earth,</hi> Eph. 6. 8.
Of which Ties and Promiſes, <hi>Gentile</hi> Slaves being
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56561:72"/>
deſtitute, no ſuch <hi>Fidelity</hi> can be from them hoped
for, or expected. And ſo far is this <hi>Religion</hi> from a
tendencie to <hi>Anarchy,</hi> or any <hi>Levelling Tenets</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>founded not in a Parity, but a Superiority,</hi> not in a
<hi>Domocracy,</hi> but in an <hi>Ariſtocracie)</hi> that a conformity
to that <hi>Axiom, Aequalitate nihil iniquius; Nothing
is more dangerous than Equality;</hi> has been her moſt
profeſſed and <hi>conſtant Practice</hi> from her firſt appearance
<hi>untill this very day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. Thirdly, It enjoyns to all in general an <hi>abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie
of evil,</hi> tho ſuch only in <hi>appearance.</hi> But much more
prohibiting thoſe things <hi>which are plainly ſuch,</hi> and
even of the groſſeſt and wrankeſt kind. It further puts
a reſtraint upon the <hi>Thoughts</hi> and Deſires, which no
other Religion doth; forbids us to be <hi>revengeful,</hi> or to
<hi>return evil.</hi> And therefore far out-doeth the <hi>Heathen
Divinity,</hi> which permitted <hi>Revenge in caſe of Injury,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in no caſe amongſt Chriſtians. So that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
can pick <hi>Rebellion,</hi> or <hi>cutting of Throats</hi> out of theſe
Principles, may as eaſily prove <hi>Adultery</hi> lawful from
the <hi>Seventh Commandment,</hi> or <hi>Slandering</hi> from the <hi>Ninth,</hi>
reconcile <hi>Contradictions,</hi> and bring Contraries to <hi>concur</hi>
and <hi>agree</hi> in all Points at one and the ſame time.</p>
               <p>14. And therefore the Deluſions of thoſe <hi>Atheiſts,</hi>
and <hi>Impoſtors</hi> in 1642, and afterwards, (ſince decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Parl.</hi> in 1660, to be no <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>
and as certainly no <hi>Chriſtians)</hi> to whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> will
one day return but ſmall thanks for <hi>occaſioning his
Doctrine thus to be blaſphemed;</hi> can be no ſuch convincing
Argument, that their <hi>Murthers</hi> and <hi>Depredations,</hi> tho
<hi>falſly</hi> pretending <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Inſpiration</hi> for them,
were the <hi>genuine reſult of Chriſtian Principles;</hi> until
better Proof and Reaſons for it be produced, than
their own bare Affirmations. And for the <hi>Galileans
action,</hi> it was (like other of the ſeditious attempts
of that <hi>Nation,</hi> both before and after to <hi>aſſert Liberty)</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:56561:73"/>
but a <hi>Jewiſh Dream,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf did to their no
ſmal indignation plainly diſown, and in that his anſwer
to the <hi>Herodians,</hi> St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. utterly <hi>condemn.</hi> And for
the <hi>Quakers</hi> obſtinacy (whom yet they <hi>here ſupport</hi> and
<hi>encourage</hi> againſt the <hi>Miniſters)</hi> I know no further nor
better uſe can be made of it, than <hi>from thence to infer the
neceſſity of Church-Government,</hi> and of <hi>ſuppreſſing falſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
in Religion,</hi> from whence this Obſtinacy is occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
and derived, But not therefore to ſtifle and hinder
Men from the knowledg of that <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and Truth,
which teacheth the contrary. But our People, who in
truth have as little ſtomach to <hi>ſubmit to others,</hi> as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their <hi>Slaves</hi> have to ſubmit to them, will ſcarcely
be brought to approve of this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> or <hi>Inference.</hi> Tho
theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> refuſal to bear Arms, and to defend their
<hi>Iſland,</hi> (no not in caſe of an Invaſion) together with their
<hi>Commiſſion dormant</hi> of <hi>New Light</hi> and Revelation, <hi>reſerved
againſt ſome fit time</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> of Action (whereby
no Man is ſecure) do often put them upon thoughts of
<hi>uſing Violence</hi> to that their own dear principle of <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſm,</hi>
no leſs than to the others <hi>tender Conſciences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>15. Laſtly, For <hi>Inſurrections</hi> and <hi>Revolts,</hi> nothing
can be imagined a greater <hi>Security</hi> againſt them, than
a ſincere inward perſuaſion of the truth of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
with a thorow <hi>knowledg</hi> of its Principles. Of which
the effects have been lately ſeen in <hi>New-England,</hi> where
their <hi>Chriſtian-Indians Fidelity</hi> was tried to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt;
encountred on the one hand by the <hi>jealous ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of their Friends,</hi> and on the other by the both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations
and threatnings of their <hi>Enemies,</hi> if at leaſt
we may ſo term their <hi>unconverted</hi> Country-men: Yet
<hi>in deſpite of all,</hi> they remained <hi>firm to the Engliſh.</hi> Who,
<hi>after that they durſt truſt them,</hi> became very ſerviceable
to our People there, as hath been atteſted by more than
one of their <hi>Writers.</hi> So powerful are the Bonds
of Religion to unite the minds of Men, tho of moſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56561:73"/>
different and even contrary <hi>Intereſts:</hi> And when ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and hearty proving <hi>indiſſolvable,</hi> tho under the
darkeſt <hi>Eclipſe</hi> and trial of <hi>Adverſity.</hi> Making Men to
<hi>forget their own People, and their Fathers Houſe,</hi> and
joyning them in affection to the moſt <hi>diſtant Strangers.</hi>
For theſe having ſo fair an opportunity of <hi>Revolting,</hi>
and all the invitements and arguments for it, which
Men upon ſuch occaſions could wiſh for; as, the ridding
their Country of <hi>Foraigners,</hi> and the enriching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the <hi>Spoils</hi> of their well-built and better
furniſhed Houſes; their <hi>Lands</hi> manured and ſtored
with <hi>Cattel,</hi> and abounding with many other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies,
which themſelves never were bleſſed with:
And laſtly, the <hi>Royetlets</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Tribes</hi> of that <hi>ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>
Continent, all in a manner up in Arms, and <hi>üna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous</hi>
for the <hi>rooting</hi> them out of it. Yet none of all
theſe conſiderations could prevail with thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi>
whoſe minds were thus ſeaſoned with <hi>Religion,</hi> to
falſifie their <hi>Faith</hi> once plighted to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> With
whom doubtleſs things might have gone <hi>much harder,</hi>
had they been <hi>deſerted</hi> by them. And they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
<hi>(all things conſidered)</hi> have been glad to leave
their more <hi>Inland Stations,</hi> and forced to retire and
betake themſelves to their greater Strengths on the
<hi>Sea-Coaſt;</hi> there to have remained <hi>pent up,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing
ever to recover their <hi>loſt Territory,</hi> but by the
aid of <hi>extrinſic</hi> force, which would (probably) have
coſt them more, than <hi>they are willing to part with.</hi>
And to come a little nearer, even to our own <hi>Iſland,</hi>
where 'tis poſſible that the late <hi>Plot</hi> had not been ſo
near taking effect, had the greater, or indeed any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
number of the <hi>Negro's</hi> here been <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> One
thing more I ſhall add, that the <hi>Spaniſh Indians</hi> in
<hi>America,</hi> are not recorded once to have rebelled ſince
their firſt <hi>Reduction</hi> under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Power; nor have
the Conquerers themſelves been diſturbed with any
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56561:74"/>
                  <hi>Inteſtine Broyls,</hi> that have been conſiderable; which
is more then we can boaſt of in our <hi>Colonies;</hi> tho ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(I ſpeak even of the <hi>Eldeſt of them)</hi> not above
one third part of the time, that the <hi>other</hi> have <hi>enjoyed</hi>
theirs. Which effect I can aſcribe to nothing more,
then to the force and power of <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>16. But there is one <hi>Inſtance</hi> worth all that can be
<hi>produced,</hi> or ſaid upon this Subject, and that is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the <hi>Theban Legion;</hi> which I ſhall preſent in
the words of a <hi>Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Dudley Diggs,</hi> of the unlawfulneſs of Subjects taking up Arms againſt their Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>.
<q>It is, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> one
of the nobleſt paſſages in
all the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
wherein Chriſtianity
did ſhine forth in its full Luſtre, and it affords plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Light for our inſtruction. This band conſiſted
of almoſt 7000 Men, all Chriſtians. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<hi>Maximian</hi> commands the whole Army to offer
Sacrifice to falſe Gods; they remove their Quarters,
that they might avoid, if it were poſſible, this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of diſcontenting him. He ſummons them to
perform their part in this deviliſh Worſhip. They
are forced to return an humble denial, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
not to diſobey God, for whoſe ſake they
had ever been, and would continue faithful Servants
unto him. The Emperour unſatisfied with this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
puts them to a <hi>Decimation.</hi> They ſubmit with
much Cheerfulneſs, and die, praying for their Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.
After this ſad Spectacle, his Commands
are renewed; but prevail nothing upon the <hi>Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi>
wherefore they are all Butchered without the
leaſt reſiſtance. There was no delay in their Death,
except from the wearineſs of the Executioners.
This was truly to confeſs him, <hi>who was led as a Sheep
to the ſlaughter,</hi> and <hi>like a Lamb opened not his Mouth;</hi>
and they a Flock of his Fold, are quietly devoured
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56561:74"/>
                     <hi>by ravening Wolves.</hi> The Commander of this Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Mauritius</hi> could not contain his joy, when he
had ſeen the firſt Decimation gallantly ſuffered. How
fearful was I, ſaid he, to his Fellow Souldiers (for
armed Men may be tempted to defend themſelves),
leſt any of them upon colour of juſt reſiſtance for
ſelf-preſervation in an innocent Cauſe, ſhould have
ſtruggled againſt this bleſſed Slaughter, I was watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and had <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Example in readineſs, who
commanded his Diſciple <hi>to put his Sword into the
Scabbard. Salus veſtra non periclitatur, niſi armis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris;</hi>
If you uſe not your Weapons, <hi>I have God's own
Warrant for your ſafety.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>17. <q>Deſpair it ſelf could not conquer one ſingle
Patience, which yet creates valour in Cowards, and
makes them more couragious in Extremities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are Fearful; ſince they are likely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
moſt to preſerve Life, who are moſt terrified
with Death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>18. <q>But it may be objected, <hi>Vires deerant,</hi> they
were not able to go thorow with the Rebellion. This
very Objection, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> was made by the Ancients,
and anſwered by themſelves to our Hands. Their
Speeches witneſs ſufficient ſtrength, if Religion had
not tied their Hands. Which had they been other than
truth, muſt have armed their ſo potent Adverſaries
with ſufficient <hi>Arguments</hi> againſt them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>19. The ſame <hi>learned Author</hi> goes on, and tells us
that, <q>St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith expreſsly, <hi>Quamvis nimius &amp;
copioſus noſter ſit populus;</hi> Tho we have competent
Forces enough, yet we wreſtle not with our Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.
The <hi>Theban Legion</hi> was in a poſture of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
but they durſt not lift up thoſe hands, into
which the Emperour had put Weapons, againſt his
Perſonal Commands, tho unjuſt and bloody. Six
thouſand ſix hundred ſixty ſix Men, of ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56561:75"/>
Valour, as did not entertain the leaſt fear
of Death, might probably have conquered, (and
this Cruelty might have encreaſed their Party, by
the defection of Male-contents) at leaſt they muſt
certainly have made ſome ſport for their Lives:
They could not have wanted that Comfort, which
to ſome taſtes is beyond the pleaſure of Life, <hi>to die
revenged.</hi> Beſides, had not the Emperour and his
Council known them <hi>true Chriſtians,</hi> and been acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the tameneſs of that Profeſſion towards the
Higher Powers, he would never have hazarded a
Rebellion, by making ſo conſiderable an Army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate.</q>
               </p>
               <p>20. <q>And <hi>Tertullian, Cui bello idonei non prompti fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſemus,
etiam impares copiis, qui tam libentur trucida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur;</hi>
How could they poſſibly receive a Foil, tho
ſhort in number, who ſo quietly do ſuffer our
Throats to be cut? <hi>Numeri damnum virtus penſaret,</hi>
tho we wanted the advantage of number, which you
perceive we do not, Courage would ſupply that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
And tho fewer, ſince we contemn our own
Lives, we might be Maſters of yours. We could
undo you, not if we ſhould Rebel, but if we would
be Idle; we were loſt, if we did not Fight for you.
<hi>Veſtra omnia implevimus, caſtra ipſa,</hi> &amp;c. We fill all
places in the Empire, and even your Camp would
be empty without us <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The ſame Father
makes a bold Challenge, and deſires them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
if they can, but one example of any <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
taking part with Rebels. Their unanimous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
was, We kiſs the Hands that wound us, and
the Example of Chriſt is made our Law. <hi>Inde eſt
quod nemo noſtrum, quando apprehenditur, reluctatur, nec
ſe adverſus injuſtam violentiam veſtram, quamvis nimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
&amp; copioſus noſter ſit populus, ulciſcitur.</hi> For this cauſe
none of us makes reſiſtance, when apprehended, nor
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56561:75"/>
revengeth your unjuſt Violence; for God is able to
reward our Patience, and to requite all our Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<hi>Si injuriam,</hi> &amp;c. If you depend upon God,
he will undertake your Quarrel, and revenge your
Wrongs; your Wounds ſhall ſave you: and if you
fall a Martyr, you ſhall riſe a Saint. What cannot
our Sufferings do? They make even God our Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
He owes us Heaven for our ſelves, and Hell
for our Enemies, but we breath out our Souls in
Prayer, that he may be entreated not to pay this.
Here is the Patience and Faith of the Saints; they
believed, therefore they ſuffered ſuch things,</q> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Thus far that <hi>loyal</hi> and <hi>ingenious Perſon,</hi> in whom is
legible the <hi>genuine temper</hi> and <hi>ſpirit of a Chriſtian;</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it can be ſuppoſed that the whole multitude of
them, <hi>as well their more learned Guides,</hi> as the ignorant
and ſimple, were wholly unacquainted with their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi>
And from hence, with what elſe-where hath
been ſaid, I may ſafely preſume to conclude, that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
which obligeth Men to the ſtricteſt Vertue,</hi> and that
upon ſuch weighty Motives, as no Profeſſion did ever
pretend to, <hi>is ſo far from working Miſchief to Superiours
and Governours, that it rather appears of abſolute neceſſity
for the ſecurity both of Themſelves and their Affairs, that
their Subjects be thorowly acquainted with it;</hi> As, er'e
I come to cloſe up my Diſcourſe, <hi>I hope,</hi> I ſhall yet
further ſhew.</p>
               <p>§. II. 1. The firſt and great <hi>danger</hi> which concerns
their <hi>Lives</hi> being eſcaped, I come to examine the <hi>two
laſt</hi> Objections, which for their near <hi>affinity</hi> and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
I ſhall twiſt together, and diſpatch under one.
Theſe do concern their <hi>Eſtates</hi> and worldly <hi>Intereſts,</hi>
things no leſs dear unto them; but both dearer than
<hi>Religion;</hi> for otherwiſe ſuch Objections had not been
to be anſwered. Now in the firſt they affirm, Their
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56561:76"/>
                  <hi>Eſtates</hi> will be threatned no leſs than four ſeveral ways;
of each of which I ſhall give this ſhort, but true Account;
<hi>viz.</hi> That, the firſt <hi>is Idle and Ridiculous;</hi> the ſecond
<hi>Sordid and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian:</hi> The third a <hi>mixture of Gentile
and Mahumetan</hi> Superſtition and Irreligion: The fourth
<hi>Inhumane and Monſtrous, a reproach to Mankind,</hi> and a
<hi>diſhonour to the Engliſh Government and Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. For the firſt, They affirm their Eſtates will ſuffer
by the <hi>Charges</hi> from hence enſuing: As by <hi>Baptizing,
Marrying, Churching,</hi> and <hi>Burying</hi> their <hi>Slaves.</hi> All
now either totally omitted, or elſe performed by the
<hi>Overſeers,</hi> (in a kind of prophane Merriment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion
as it were of the Ordinances), or (as in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage)
by mutual agreement amongſt themſelves; and
(as is uſed jeſtingly here to be ſaid, when ſpeaking
of the <hi>Quakers</hi> (like) Marriages) <hi>after the Negro fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion.</hi>
As for <hi>Viſitation of the Sick,</hi> I ſhall not inſert it
in the Liſt, becauſe here laid aſide in a manner by all,
beſides <hi>the richer Engliſh.</hi> The other (like <hi>thoſe poor
deſperate Souls in Limbo, that for wont of Money,</hi> have
no Body to pray them out) being by the remoteneſs
of their Habitations, the frequent <hi>badneſs</hi> of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Ways, the <hi>ſcarcity of Miniſters,</hi> an <hi>evil,
but little felt, tho much fewer,</hi> (notwithſtanding <hi>there
are not above five;)</hi> and the numerouſneſs of the <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi>
(ſuppoſed not fewer than one hundred and odd
thouſands) not poſſibly to be thought on, unleſs we
ſhould ſuppoſe the Miniſters always on Horſe-back for
that very work: And then <hi>who ſhould preach (without
Book) upon Sundays?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3.<note place="margin">A County in <hi>England</hi> of the ſame extent with this <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland,</hi> has commonly 100 or more <hi>Pariſhes</hi> and <hi>Miniſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> all, one with an other, not worſe provided for Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, tho not a quarter ſo <hi>Populous</hi> nor <hi>Rich</hi> as theſe here.</note> Secondly, They appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that this would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a <hi>neceſſity of enlarging
their Churches,</hi> and encreaſing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56561:76"/>
the <hi>number of Pariſhes</hi> and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> of both which
there are but too many already, <hi>half of the Churches
being deſtitute of Miniſters,</hi> tho but <hi>Eleven</hi> in all. And
in thoſe Churches that are better ſupplied, 'tis known
that the <hi>Prayers and Sermons</hi> are uſually delivered to
<hi>little more than the bare Walls</hi> only, notwithſtanding
the multitude of People belonging to each; of whom
not a fifth part <hi>(I ſpeak only of the Engliſh)</hi> could be
admitted into moſt of them, <hi>ſhould they all appear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Thirdly, They add the time to be ſpent in this
(needleſs) <hi>work of Religion,</hi> which amongſt ſo many
<hi>labouring Hands</hi> muſt be conſiderable. Beſides their
<hi>Sunday-work,</hi> would be quite loſt, as alſo their <hi>increaſe
by the</hi> Negro's <hi>Polygamy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Fourthly, They have a ſtrange apprehenſion
and foreſight, <hi>that their Slaves when admitted</hi> Chriſtians,
would be apt to expect better uſage <hi>(which even Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
will tell them they ought to have without it)</hi> for <hi>Food,
Clothes,</hi> and <hi>Reſt,</hi> and more <hi>merciful Correction,</hi> mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
according <hi>to ſome Law,</hi> (and not left to each Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
pleaſure) which perchance, <hi>may be but reaſonable.</hi>
Theſe, as indeed the former, they ſparingly mention,
being aſhamed <hi>to own,</hi> and it were to be wiſhed they
would alſo to <hi>practiſe,</hi> them. Of all which I ſhall leave
others to judg, whether they do not fully anſwer my
ſhort <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Deſcription</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>6. But as <hi>bad</hi> as theſe are, the following <hi>are worſe;</hi>
wherein like down-right <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

they ſtand up for <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertiniſm,</hi>
and object directly
againſt Chriſtianity, blaming
the equability and juſtice of
its Terms, the thing that chiefly renders it commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.
Theſe they complain of, as on the one hand
too large, but on the other too ſtraight and narrow,
in neither able to content them, being both, they ſay,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56561:77"/>
inconſiſtent with Bondage. Theſe Terms are, 1. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges.
2. Prohibitions.</p>
               <p>6. The <hi>Privileges</hi> are chiefly theſe three: Firſt, Their
<hi>Slaves admittance to an Oath,</hi> which, being at preſent
<hi>Heathens,</hi> are ſcarce currant <hi>in a Chriſtian Court;</hi> as
ſome of them have been made to underſtand in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
from a certain Judg's <hi>reprehending</hi> and <hi>menacing</hi> of
them for their brutiſh neglect herein; tho they were
not <hi>ignorant</hi> of it before. Secondly, Their <hi>equality as
to the Communion</hi> and <hi>Church-Adminiſtrations;</hi> which, to
all are, or ought to be, the ſame. Thirdly, The <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience</hi>
that may enſue upon their acquaintance with
this Precept of our Bleſſed Saviour; <hi>Thou ſhalt love
thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> It may perchance be expected
that I ſhould add a fourth, <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>ſuppoſed Right to
Freedom,</hi> and <hi>of being ſet at Liberty</hi> immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> which is by ſome apprehended to be
in it ſelf <hi>a releaſe from Servitude.</hi> To which laſt, (tho
it be needleſs, they having ſecured that <hi>Intereſt,</hi> as I
have underſtood, by a Law of their own, whoſe <hi>Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
they do not queſtion,)</hi> I ſhall ſpeak ſomething alſo,
after having firſt replied to the three former.</p>
               <p>7. The firſt whereof is their <hi>admiſſion to an Oath,</hi>
wherein they ſeem again to have forgotten, the thing
I am interceding and ſuing for on their behalf, <hi>viz.
That they may be made Chriſtians;</hi> which, as is before
ſhewed, is certainly of it ſelf a ſufficient remedy and
ſecurity againſt <hi>all temptations to Perjury.</hi> A <hi>Crime,</hi>
which according to the true Principles thereof, <hi>is next
to irremiſſible:</hi> And for which the <hi>Ancient Canons</hi> did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
Penance to the Offender during <hi>his Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. And yet ſhould we ſuppoſe the worſt, I cannot
imagine the danger to be greater than it was in <hi>former
Ages,</hi> when both <hi>Slaves</hi> and Villains were freely admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
without this ſcruple, to give Evidence; even as
in <hi>Poland,</hi> and elſewhere, 'tis not to be doubted, but
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56561:77"/>
they ſtill are. Nor do I conceive that St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought
his <hi>Chriſtian Slaves</hi> Oath more to be ſuſpected
than other Mens, whilſt they no leſs ſtuck to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> And in truth, at the ſame rate,
all the World may be no leſs ſuſpected: it being poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that all Men may prove deceitful and wicked, tho
not in the leaſt probable.</p>
               <p>9. That their <hi>Oath may be uſeful,</hi> we even now
find, where their bare word or teſtimony given without
it, is often found very ſerviceable, tho not admitted
for a ſufficient proof. The want whereof is many times
no ſmall <hi>impediment</hi> to the <hi>courſe</hi> of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> And for
<hi>Subornations,</hi> the thing chiefly objected; for my part,
as I ſee not but they might (eſpecially being made
<hi>Chriſtians)</hi> be as well truſted as moſt others; ſo ſhould
any ſuch thing happen, it will be preſumed that the
<hi>wiſe Judges</hi> will be no leſs <hi>Eagle-ſighted,</hi> and able to
deſcry ſuch practices in theſe, than in the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. As for the ſecond, it is hard to find out what
they intend by it, unleſs it ſhould be that the <hi>Negro's</hi>
would thereby be apt to think <hi>more proudly of themſelves,</hi>
and leſs worthily of their <hi>Maſters;</hi> which yet cannot
be gathered from <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> nor indeed can ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
if St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule be well applied; <hi>And they that
have believing Maſters, let them not deſpiſe them, becauſe
they are Brethren, but rather do them</hi> [the better] <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
becauſe they are Believers,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. So that this
<hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Maſter</hi> is ſo far from being hereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed,
that it is rather confirmed, and a ſtricter
obſervance for that cauſe charged upon the Servants
<hi>Conſcience.</hi> Nor do we find that <hi>Abraham, Job,</hi> &amp;c.
were the leſs eſteemed by their <hi>Bondmen,</hi> for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
initiated <hi>into Religion,</hi> by the ſame <hi>Ceremonies</hi> with
themſelves; neither do we find or ſuſpect this in our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Servants, or Dependents. That Woman alſo
whoſe <hi>Negro (P.</hi> 38.) I baptized, had not more cauſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56561:78"/>
to complain that he thereafter failed in his <hi>Duty</hi> and
<hi>Fidelity,</hi> tho ſhe quarrel'd at it. Nor yet two others
in <hi>Virginia</hi> (the former being in <hi>Carolina)</hi> whom I
likewiſe Baptized, were ever taxed by their <hi>Maſters,</hi> as
leſs diligent after <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> than they were before. Nor
laſtly, did the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian Maſters,</hi> nor I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
hardly any other Sect, ever aſcribe to <hi>Religion</hi>
the diſorders of their Servants as the cauſe thereof, if
at any time they found themſelves diſreſpected by
them. Except only the <hi>Romans Saturnalia,</hi> wherein
the Slaves were permitted to retaliate their Maſters
cruelties; which extravagancy <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> doth not
in the leaſt allow of. And for the <hi>third,</hi> they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that if Chriſt hath taught, <hi>That we ſhould love
our Neighbours as our ſelves,</hi> his Apoſtle hath from his
Mouth alſo, no leſs enjoyned <hi>Servants obedience to
their Maſters;</hi> which two <hi>Precepts</hi> do no more thwart
either the other, than that of the fame Apoſtle, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding,
To <hi>render to every Man his due,</hi> and <hi>Maſters to
allow their Servants that which is juſt and equal,</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
their juſt Right and <hi>Authority</hi> over them. And
this, if we were to deal with Men that had any ſenſe
of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> (which the Objection doth
moſt evidently ſhew that they have not) might prove
ſatisfactory to them; but as the caſe ſtands, 'tis not
to be <hi>hoped</hi> will much avail to their <hi>Conviction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. And as to that which ſome would in the <hi>fourth</hi>
place object, touching their releaſe from ſervitude
upon <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> tho I do not ſee that they here do
retain any <hi>apprehenſions</hi> thereof, their <hi>Law</hi> (of which
I have only heard mention here, but do know that
there is ſuch both in <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Mary-land)</hi> having
carefully <hi>barred all ſuch Pleas;</hi> yet were there no ſuch
Law enacted, I cannot underſtand that a neceſſity for
ſuch a releaſe doth ariſe from any Principles of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
nor of <hi>Religion</hi> in general. For if we look into
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56561:78"/>
the Old Teſtament, we find that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> (to the
Faithful then the ſame with <hi>Baptiſm</hi> now) did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s three hundred and eighteen Slaves, nor
thoſe afterwards belonging to his Poſterity, any more
than <hi>their partaking of the Paſſover,</hi> Exod. 12. did; of
which yet <hi>no hired Servant was to eat.</hi> And the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>
were perpetual <hi>Bondmen</hi> and <hi>Vaſſals,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their admittance to the <hi>Temple,</hi> and to <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
And then to come to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and the <hi>New
Teſtament, Oneſimus,</hi> who is ſtiled [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Slave]
(to <hi>Philemon)</hi> as (that word importing no leſs) is
generally agreed, was not made a Freeman by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Baptized;</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s returning him to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> alſo, and his interceeding for him, doth
manifeſt. Whom tho he beſpeaks as a <hi>Convert,</hi> yet lets
him know that his Obligation to his <hi>Maſter</hi> was ſtill
the ſame. And tho he profeſſeth that he might be
much bold in Chriſt to enjoyn <hi>Philemon</hi> that which was
convenient, yet that he choſe rather to entreat him by
Love: And what was that? Not that he might be
ſet at liberty, as being now a Chriſtian, and <hi>even a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
but that, forgetting wherein he had offended,
being now a Penitent and a <hi>Convert,</hi> he would <hi>receive
him</hi> again. Nor againſt this do we find <hi>Oneſimus</hi> urging
his Privilege, nor refuſing to carry the Letter with his
own hand. A manifeſt ſign that there was then no
ſuch underſtood, or heard of. And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 21,
22. where the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts the privilege of
Chriſtian Servants, he withal tells them their Duty,
giving them to know, that they were <hi>to abide in the ſame
Calling, wherein they were</hi> when firſt converted, or <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;</hi>
not but that if they could procure <hi>their liberty, they
ſhould rather uſe it.</hi> And if any ſhall demand what
then is that liberty of a Chriſtian, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
aſſerts and urgeth? I anſwer, That I know no
more by it, than a <hi>liberty from the yoke of Judaiſm,</hi> from
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56561:79"/>
                  <hi>Sabbaths, Circumciſion,</hi> and ſuch like Ordinances and
Levitical Ceremonies. As alſo a releaſe from our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſlavery to our <hi>Luſts,</hi> which is the greateſt liberty
and happineſs, if conſidered and underſtood. And
laſtly, An admiſſion <hi>to ſerve Chriſt, our moſt perfect
Freedom,</hi> and to partake of the Privileges and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and thereby to obtain an <hi>Adoption
to the glorious liberty of the Sons of God in Heaven.</hi> Which
certainly are far greater Immunities, than a bare releaſe
from temporal Servitude can poſſibly amount to. For
Chriſt's <hi>Kingdom</hi> being not of this World, his <hi>Religion</hi>
was never deſigned to deprive any Man of his <hi>civil
Rights,</hi> but rather did <hi>confirm them all to us.</hi> And to
ſhew that <hi>Bondage</hi> is not <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
we ſee it practiſed by other Chriſtian Nations in theſe
parts without the leaſt prejudice to them: Even as not
one hundred Years ſince in <hi>England, Villanage,</hi> a kind
of <hi>Slavery,</hi> was in force, and ſtill is in other Countries,
and ſome do ſay, in our own too.</p>
               <p>13. And whereas 'tis further Objected, That cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Imperial Edicts</hi> (neither of them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
here), and the <hi>Municipal Laws</hi> of ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
('tis poſſible of <hi>England</hi> it ſelf) heretofore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
or decreed for the honour of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or to
ſtrengthen its Party againſt the <hi>Heathen,</hi> do oppoſe
this continuation of our <hi>Slaves</hi> in Bondage. I anſwer,
Firſt, That theſe Laws being deſigned for the good
of Servants, and the promoting of Chriſtianity, there
is now no reaſon they ſhould be continued, when <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally</hi>
found, through <hi>the hardneſs of Mens Heats,</hi>
ſo great impediments thereto; and even to be turned
againſt them, <hi>for the benefit of whoſe Bodies and Souls
they were intended.</hi> But, Secondly, I add, that this (tho
true) doth not trouble my Aſſertion, becauſe we do
not find that theſe Laws do flow from any neceſſity
thereof, concluded in the Principles of Chriſtianity;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56561:79"/>
as being meerly <hi>voluntary,</hi> and the effects only of the
good Nature and Piety of their firſt Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers;
and to which a Chriſtian (as ſuch) is no more
bound, than to <hi>ſell all his Goods, and give them to the
Poor:</hi> Which yet may be a good work, and very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
in thoſe that ſhall aſpire after ſuch perfection.</p>
               <p>14. But yet further, if any ſhall make it a matter of
<hi>Conſcience</hi> to continue Chriſtians in Servitude; it would
concern thoſe that entertain that ſcruple (which I
fear few do) to remember how much more againſt
a good Conſcience it is, either through Sloth, or for
a petty Profit, to keep <hi>Men, that have Souls to be ſaved,</hi>
deſtitute of the means thereto, and conſequently <hi>to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
their Damnation;</hi> than ſimply to retain them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Servitude, abſtracted from that other <hi>Irreligion.</hi>
Which tho perhaps leſs commendable in <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> is
far ſhort of the Impiety of keeping them <hi>Slaves to Hell,</hi>
and to <hi>our ſelves too.</hi> And here alſo, ſuppoſing the
worſt, it ought by Chriſtians to be conſidered how
much the loſs of a <hi>Servant</hi> is leſs than of a <hi>Soul,</hi> (yea
of many) <hi>for whom Chriſt died,</hi> no leſs <hi>than for their
Maſters;</hi> and who cannot expect to be <hi>ſaved,</hi> if the
other, <hi>through their occaſion,</hi> periſhes. But letting
this ſcruple paſs, (to ſalve which there never will
be here any occaſion), I think it clear enough that
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> doth not leſſen any obligations of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to their lawful <hi>Maſters:</hi> And therefore that
if any <hi>poſitive Laws</hi> to the contrary do as yet ſtand
in their way, I ſhould be apt to recommend the <hi>Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
caution</hi> of <hi>Indentures</hi> for 99 years Service, to
our Peoples <hi>imitation,</hi> in the <hi>interim</hi> till thoſe Laws (I
ſay, if any ſuch there be) might by <hi>Authority</hi> be fairly
removed.</p>
               <p>§. III. 1. And thus our dangers from the <hi>Privileges</hi>
being cleared, I proceed to do the like by the <hi>Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56561:80"/>
viz.</hi> Of their <hi>Polygamy,</hi> their <hi>Sunday-Labour,</hi>
frequent <hi>repudiating</hi> and changing their Wives, uſual
amongſt moſt <hi>Heathens.</hi> As alſo their <hi>Idolatrous Dances</hi>
and Revels, permitted and practiſed by them (ſo often as
they can ſteal any time from their Work) <hi>even upon that
Day,</hi> whoſe <hi>Morality</hi> (to the danger of ſtraining it to
the height of a <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath)</hi> hath been ſo much,
for theſe many Years, inſiſted on amongſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi>
with other ſuch <hi>Recreations</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> by them
brought out of <hi>Africa,</hi> and here connived at, becauſe
either <hi>gainful to their Owners,</hi> (ſuch as the firſt) or
grateful to the <hi>poor Slave</hi> (ſuch as the latter) <hi>without
prejudice to their Maſters Buſineſs.</hi> None of which yet
are heard of amongſt the <hi>Virginia Negro's,</hi> tho alike
<hi>Gentiles</hi> with theſe: And there not laid aſide or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
but forgotten by diſuſe.</p>
               <p>2. Now might not this cauſe one to ſtand ſtill and
to admire, how ſuch things ſhould come to be, I do
not ſay, <hi>juſtified,</hi> but even permitted, or endured by
Chriſtians: Who, as before they were not aſhamed to
begrudge the poor Wretches <hi>thus ſpending their ſtrength
and days in their Service,</hi> even a miſerable Subſiſtence,
for they expect no more: So here they alledge things
palpably wicked, as a pretence for a worſe and more
dangerous <hi>Frugality,</hi> if I may ſo call it, <hi>viz. The ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of their Souls.</hi> Contenting themſelves to give a
free courſe to <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Licentiouſneſs, and
even to all <hi>Irreligion</hi> and <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> for a wretched falſe
Gain; but in the mean time <hi>blindly overlooking the many
greater Advantages, which are the undoubted fruit of true
Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. For can it be believed that the ſmall trouble of
<hi>Chriſtenings,</hi> to be had without <hi>Fees;</hi> as alſo of <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing,
Marrying, Churching</hi> and <hi>Burying</hi> of them (the
conſenting to <hi>which</hi> will one Day, like <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s good
deeds for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Tobit</hi>'s charity for the Dead, be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56561:80"/>
our greateſt comfort;) can
equal,<note place="margin">Think upon me, O my God, for good according to all that I have done for this People, <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.</note> or any way be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the ſolid benefit and
ſatisfaction ariſing from the
unqueſtionable <hi>Fidelity</hi> and
<hi>Integrity of a vertuous Servant?</hi> Can a few hours <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Work</hi>
(for I plead not for the other <hi>Holy-days)</hi> be
alike beneficial to us, as the ſame ſpent in learning
them their Duty, or <hi>as the bleſſing of God</hi> upon us for it
in the enſuing Week? Can <hi>ſtarving, or working them to
Death,</hi> (for it cannot be denied but that theſe are too
frequent) be equally <hi>profitable with keeping them alive</hi>
for our future Service? Or can we believe it alike <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,</hi>
or conducive to our <hi>Intereſt,</hi> to be put each
Year to purchaſe and train up <hi>Raw, Ignorant,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handy
Barbarians,</hi> with preſerving for our <hi>occaſions,</hi> the
tried and more experienced, by good <hi>uſage</hi> of them?
'Tis true, you may alledg the temptation and <hi>certainty
of the preſent Profit,</hi> with the uncertainty of <hi>future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies,</hi>
the poſſibility of their out-living thoſe <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi>
and of their dying alſo under <hi>better uſage;</hi> yet
ſurely this is but a <hi>brutiſh Plea,</hi> and at beſt not a little
ſavouring of their <hi>Providence,</hi> who <hi>devour all at one
Meal, as uncertain whether ever they ſhould live to enjoy
another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. As for the charge of <hi>Inſtructing</hi> them, if they
think it too much to undertake themſelves, (which
the <hi>holy Patriarchs</hi> did not) they cannot but know
the ſame Perſon who attends this work upon <hi>Sundays,</hi>
or <hi>Saturdays Afternoon,</hi> (which laſt was formerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to both Slaves and Servants, when this <hi>Iſland</hi>
was leſs Wealthy and Populous, than now it is) may
be further uſeful in the reſt of the Week; particularly
in teaching their <hi>own,</hi> and the neighbouring <hi>Youth,</hi> (or
poſſibly in keeping their <hi>Accounts,</hi> &amp;c.) which would
prevent a greater Charge, together with the hazard
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56561:81"/>
of tranſporting them to <hi>Europe</hi> for <hi>Education:</hi> Not
omitting that ſo much (beyond the <hi>dangers</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi>
and of different <hi>Climes)</hi> worſe miſchief of their being
betimes <hi>Debauched;</hi> ſcarce to be avoided at ſo great a
diſtance from their <hi>Parents care and inſpection,</hi> as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Inſtances is too apparent. And this alſo might be
a means in ſome meaſure to put a ſtop to that <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm,</hi>
which through the want of <hi>Schools,</hi> do threaten
the irrecoverable <hi>Ruine</hi> of all our <hi>Hopes in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>19. As for the danger of our <hi>Slaves releaſe from Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude</hi>
thereby, to what I have ſaid before, I ſhall only
add, That if they ſuſpect the <hi>Validity</hi> of their own
<hi>Laws,</hi> the contrary to which I have always found;
no doubt but his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and the Honourable Houſes
of <hi>Parliament,</hi> will have their Ears open to their juſt
Fears and Complaints, thus ariſing from a pious ſenſe
of their <hi>Duty,</hi> and the ſafety of their Peoples <hi>Souls,</hi>
no leſs than of their own; ſo as to fortifie their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi>
with as good Laws and Fences, as themſelves
ſhall in <hi>Reaſon</hi> propoſe, or their <hi>Omnipotencie</hi> (pardon
the expreſſion, <hi>Rulers</hi> can do much within their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Spheres)</hi> can <hi>create,</hi> or give life to. Nor let that
over-proud fear of thereby acknowledging <hi>(what
they cannot poſſibly avoid,)</hi> their dependence upon
<hi>England,</hi> nor that of rendring the reſt of their Laws,
with their <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> (which, I confeſs, ſome
would fain extend beyond its <hi>due bounds)</hi> queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
be any impediment thereto; ſince neither the
one nor the other are more <hi>ſecured</hi> without it: And
theſe two being known to be <hi>different things</hi> in Law,
<hi>viz. To corroborate an old,</hi> and <hi>create a new Title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. And for the charge of dividing and leſſning the
<hi>Pariſhes,</hi> (very neceſſary if but the for <hi>Engliſh</hi> alone)
and the encreaſing the number both of <hi>Churches</hi> and
<hi>Miniſters</hi> (tho this doth not abſolutely follow; the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56561:81"/>
foregoing Expedient being admitted, nor perhaps
without it;) All the danger which from thence is like
to ariſe, is, that thereby we are like to be made better
Chriſtians, and by ſuch a convenience <hi>enabled more duly
to ſerve God;</hi> a benefit well worth the <hi>purchaſing</hi> at ſo
ſmall an <hi>Expence.</hi> Tho Chriſtians in ſuch a caſe ſhould
firſt reflect upon the <hi>Prophets</hi> reply to King <hi>Amaziah,</hi>
2 Chron. 25. 9. <hi>The Lord is able to give thee mucb more
than this.</hi> And the old <hi>Jewiſh Aphoriſm, Decima
ut dives fias,</hi> anſwering to our Engliſh <hi>Adage,</hi> that
<hi>Meat and Maſs,</hi> (others have rendred it, <hi>Prayer</hi>
and <hi>Provender) do never hinder Work,</hi> do confirm that
in the Sum total, <hi>Nothing is loſt by our attending upon
God's Service and Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Hereby alſo, beſides the <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Long-livedneſs</hi>
of their <hi>Slaves</hi> (which would abundantly recompence
the loſs of other leſs commendable <hi>Profits</hi> and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages),
their gettings would not be ſo clogg'd <hi>with thoſe
troubleſome gripes,</hi> and <hi>ſtings of Conſcience,</hi> which firſt or
laſt are the certain <hi>Appendices</hi> of <hi>unlawful</hi> and <hi>bloody</hi>
Gain; nor with that <hi>Curſe</hi> denounced by the <hi>Prophet,
Hab.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8. for ſuch Unmercifulneſs and Impiety. Nor
would their <hi>Eſtates</hi> be ſo ſubject to that Moth and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
which ſome obſerving Perſons (nor <hi>over addicted
to Prieſts,</hi> nor to <hi>Religion,</hi> 'tis well known, but) even
from amongſt themſelves, have (ſo <hi>forcible are Right
words,</hi> Job 6. 25.) been brought to confeſs, as being
moſt <hi>Notorious:</hi> Who at the ſame time could not find
out any cauſe whereto to aſcribe thoſe apparent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
beſides <hi>that of oppreſſing theſe People.</hi> For as an
<hi>Achan,</hi> or a <hi>Saul</hi> may trouble <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo even very
<hi>Gibeonites</hi> may <hi>bleſs the Inheritance of the Lord.</hi> And
ſo all would be enjoyed with greater Security: And
that which now is as <hi>unſtable as Water,</hi> and a <hi>Curſe</hi>
rather than a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> would be a <hi>durable and firm Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion;</hi>

For as one very well obſerves, <q>
                     <hi>Intereſt is beſt
preſerved by Juſtice and Equity, which will entitle it to
that bleſſing from God, which he hath promiſed in his
Word, and which are naturally apt to be inſtrumental to
Providence in producing that good, which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>8. And as each <hi>private</hi> Man, ſo alſo the <hi>public</hi>
will be made more happy. <hi>Religion,</hi> ſaith one, <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
good Orders, and good Orders do create Peace and
Concord,</hi> which is a Peoples greateſt ſtrength. <hi>A Fool,
if he tread in the ways of Holineſs and Religion cannot err,</hi>
according to the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah 35. 8. There ſhall
be an High-way and a Way, and it ſhall be called the Way
of HOLINESS; the wayfering Men, tho Fools, ſhall
not err therein.</hi> And on the other ſide, <hi>Baalam</hi> hired
to procure the ruine of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> could not deviſe a more
pernicious Counſel, than to make <hi>Iſrael ſin. Livie</hi> in
his fifth Book, rehearſeth a ſpeech of <hi>Camillus,</hi> to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> wherein he appeals to their own Experience,
whether ever they had better Luck, <hi>than when they
carefully ſerved God,</hi> or <hi>worſe than when they neglected it.</hi>

That is, <hi>We</hi> [Romans] <hi>neither outnumbred
the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>nor were ſtronger than the</hi> Gauls, <hi>nor out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted
the</hi> Carthaginians, <hi>nor were more learned than the</hi>

in their natural Capacities:</hi> But by our <hi>Religion,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56561:82"/>
Piety,</hi> and by this one only point of <hi>WISDOM, that we
believed all things to be directed by the appointment of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
we have been able to worſt all other Nations. Xenophon</hi>
tells us, That the great <hi>Cyrus</hi> laid not the foundation
of his <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchie ſo much by his Valour and
<hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as a <hi>Religious</hi> Worſhip of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
even to profuſeneſs in the ſervice thereof. This
alſo was that which did aggrandize <hi>Alexander</hi> the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Empire. And hence it was,
ſaith one, That the <hi>Romans</hi> made not an unworthy
choice of a Commander, or <hi>Officer,</hi> for many Years; the
way there to be preferred, being by <hi>Religion.</hi> Therefore
this became the grand <hi>Emulation</hi> of the People, <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
Captains,</hi> and <hi>Senatours.</hi> And <hi>Comines</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded,
that hereof did ſpring the greatneſs of the
<hi>Venetian</hi> Seigniory. From thence <hi>Matchiavel</hi> admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
thoſe <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Republic's,</hi> that would keep
themſelves from Ruine, above all things to preſerve the
Rights of their Religion uncorrupt, and to <hi>maintain
it always venerable.</hi> And he further adds, <hi>That there
is no ſurer ſign of a Countries deſtruction,</hi> than <hi>to ſee in it
a contempt of Divine Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. Before I can conclude this part, I muſt crave
leave to recite another memorable paſſage out of
<hi>Livie's</hi> firſt Book of his <hi>Roman Hiſtory,</hi> as conceiving it
pertinent to the Point I am upon: It being touching
the effects of <hi>Religion</hi> upon <hi>Rome's</hi> firſt <hi>Planters,</hi> for
that alſo was a <hi>Colonie.</hi> Whom in the firſt place, he
beſpeaks to have been a <hi>People rude and ſavage:</hi> But to
abate whoſe <hi>fierceneſs,</hi> and to render them more tame
and manſuete; <hi>Numa</hi> their ſecond King, endeavours
by good <hi>Laws and Orders,</hi> to reduce them to <hi>Civility,</hi>
thereby as it were to reedifie that City, <hi>whoſe Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had before been laid by Force and Arms.</hi> Howbeit
this being too little to accompliſh his purpoſe, <hi>(a thing
worthy to be taken Notice of;)</hi> He in the next place,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56561:83"/>
deviſeth <hi>to bring them to ſome ſenſe of Religion,</hi> and <hi>the
fear of God; Rem omnium primam ad multitudinem effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciſſimam
ratus; judging this above all moſt operative upon
the generality of Men.</hi> Whereby, as it follows, their
Minds <hi>poſſeſſed with an awe of Religion;</hi> A ſolemn <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi>
and the <hi>reſpect of an Oath,</hi> did, <hi>without further Laws
or Penalties, govern the City.</hi> Nor was the bleſſing from
abroad attending their Devotion, leſs remarkable.
For, ſaith our Author, This <hi>Piety</hi> obſerved in them, did
ſo affect their Neighbours: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t civitatem totam in cultum

Sacrilegious to vex or moleſt a People, ſo addicted to the
Service of God.</hi> I ſhall leave our People to make the
<hi>Application,</hi> without adding any thing more thereto,
than what our <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> replied to the <hi>Inquiſitive
Lawyer,</hi> St. <hi>Luke 10. 37. Vade &amp; tu fac ſimiliter, Go

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein certain little Shifts and Pretences from
England are examined, and found weightleſs.
Alſo ſome few Propoſals preparatory to this
Work are laid down; with Exhortations to both
Miniſters and People, to a chearful and ſpeedy
betaking themſelves thereto.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. I. n. 1. MY three <hi>General Aſſertions</hi> being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,
I ſhould with them here draw
to a full <hi>Concluſion,</hi> did not an <hi>Objection</hi> or two from the
further Shore oblige me to the contrary. Where (as I have
heard, it was not long ſince <hi>threatned</hi> from another
place, and is ſince fallen out, tho not upon the occaſion
which they deſired, as a pretence for it;) it is feared
that the <hi>enforcing</hi> hereof (as if <hi>nothing leſs</hi> could be
uſed) would go near to endanger a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and is
therefore believed leſs ſafe to be attempted, eſpecially
in <hi>caſe</hi> it ſhould not ſucceed. Secondly, They ſuppoſe
The <hi>time to be unſeaſonable;</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> pretence, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.
Thirdly, That ſince they cannot yet compaſs to <hi>ſettle
Religion</hi> at Home, how ſhould they hope to accompliſh
any ſettlement in thoſe remote parts? So that here are
no leſs than three terrible <hi>Lions in our way</hi> to this work:
Of all which yet, if well lookt into, <hi>David's</hi> words,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 53. will be undoubtedly verified, <hi>There were they in
great fear, where no fear was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. For, Firſt, It is to be conſidered that the <hi>diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi>
between theſe two, is as wide as between the
ſetting up of a <hi>Cottage</hi> and a <hi>Palace,</hi> or the building of
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s and of a Country <hi>Church:</hi> Where he that
wants ſufficient <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Materials</hi> for the one, may
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56561:84"/>
yet be amply furniſht for the other. And here alſo is
the ſame difference as between a <hi>Being</hi> and a <hi>Well-being;</hi>
which thoſe that ſhall be apt to <hi>envie</hi> the laſt, will bluſh
to <hi>deny</hi> the firſt; this being by all granted neceſſary,
which is the utmoſt of our wiſhes here. Beſides, there
the <hi>Diſſenting Parties</hi> are at enmity with, and do op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that ſettlement, who yet, I doubt not, would all
of them put their helping hand to this: None beſides
direct <hi>Atheiſts</hi> (and I hope <hi>our good People here will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me for this)</hi> daring to object againſt it. And, <hi>for
the Time,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> has anſwer'd it to my
hand, in the <hi>Chapter</hi> before mentioned. And ſo much
ſhall ſuffice for the two laſt Objections.</p>
               <p>3. Now to the former, I ſhall anſwer, That as I
hold our Planters and Merchants <hi>Intereſts</hi> too great in
<hi>England,</hi> ever to betray them into ſuch a folly as a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;</hi>
ſo I preſume the ill ſucceſs of it elſewhere, and
the leſs probability of better here, where moſt of their
ſubſiſtance is imported from <hi>Foraign parts,</hi> would be
enough to prevent all ſuch <hi>Attempts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. But were our ſecurity againſt ſuch fears <hi>greater</hi>
and the danger <hi>leſs;</hi> yet, I muſt confeſs I am not for
<hi>forcing,</hi> but <hi>perſuading</hi> our People thereto, by good <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
and <hi>Pious Books,</hi> preached and wrote upon that
Subject: And no leſs by encouragements from the
<hi>Government</hi> (where it ought to begin) to both <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
and <hi>People,</hi> who ſhould be moſt forward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
therein. 'Tis I know out of Faſhion with
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to prefer Men for Religion, but only for
Craft and Wealth, which is the cauſe that things do
ſo happily ſucceed with us. Whereas the <hi>holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
(as alſo the practice of the wiſer Heathen) will
teach us, that the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> propereſt qualifications are
<hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Temperance;</hi> ſuch only as <hi>feared God, Men of
Truth,</hi> and <hi>that hated Covetouſneſs,</hi> being to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to that Dignity. Now if this courſe were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56561:84"/>
beſides that it would cut off all <hi>pretences</hi> for Stirs
and Commotions, this deſign could not fail of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a conſiderable progreſs in a very ſhort time. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall,
knowing how grateful a thing <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi>
is to our thriving <hi>Planters,</hi> and how <hi>Ambitious</hi> they
are to catch at every ſhadow of <hi>Title</hi> or <hi>Preferment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. But next thereto will be the procuring that this
Impiety be taken notice of and decried at Home, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in <hi>London;</hi> where they have an extraordinary
<hi>Ambition</hi> to be thought well of. This, alone, if well
underſtood, and for ſome time carefully kept up and
managed, would operate and ſtrike deeper into them,
than even St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s 14 <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> together with the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
and <hi>Comments</hi> thereupon, of a thouſand Years paſt
and to come.</p>
               <p>6. Yet ſince that this laſt muſt in all likelihood be
difficult to be brought about to any great purpoſe, our
old <hi>Engliſh Zeal</hi> being ſo much <hi>abated;</hi> I ſhall go a
nearer way to work, and propoſe ſome few things,
which ſhall concern, 1. The <hi>Miniſters.</hi> 2. The <hi>People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Concerning the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> (and here my Brethren
will, I hope, take no offence, their Infirmity and Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
herein being ſo long ſince proclaimed by the Pen
of that <hi>Quaker;)</hi> I ſhall propoſe firſt, That each <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi>
inveſted with the <hi>cure of Souls,</hi> be in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Station ſtrictly obliged, once at leaſt each Month,
to preſs this Duty from a <hi>ſuitable Text</hi> unto his charge;
not omitting the ſame at other times. But, <hi>Secondly,</hi>
That above all things they be eſpecially <hi>Exemplary</hi>
therein in their own Families, by Inſtructing and <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing</hi>
their <hi>Slaves,</hi> and in due time admitting them
to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Concerning the People, I ſhall propoſe only, That
each <hi>Owner</hi> poſſeſſed of a <hi>baptized Slave,</hi> be obliged to
allow him the free and full Exerciſe of <hi>Religion,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
compelling or ſuffering him to <hi>practiſe</hi> his former
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56561:85"/>
                  <hi>Gentiliſm.</hi> And that to hinder a Slave from being
<hi>Baptized,</hi> or to moleſt any <hi>Miniſter</hi> for doing that chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Office; or, after this, to deny him the Exerciſe of
<hi>Religion,</hi> ſhould be a preſent and abſolute releaſe to the
ſaid <hi>Slave</hi> for ever.</p>
               <p>9. But then in order hereto, it would be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and even highly neceſſary, that the <hi>Miniſters</hi> (I
ſpeak not this for <hi>my ſelf,</hi> as having no ſuch <hi>Charge,</hi>
and being reſolved ſo to continue, till they) be <hi>freed</hi>
from their <hi>Veſtry</hi> dependences, by a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
(for which the alone <hi>reſtitution</hi> of their <hi>Glebes</hi>
would in ſome places ſuffice,) and ſettled in their
<hi>Benefices for Life:</hi> For otherwiſe they ſhall paſs their
time in perpetual <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>offending,</hi> and to be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Checkt and Starved for <hi>conſcienciouſly diſcharging
their Duty.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">For what Encouragement is it for Men to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Public Service, and venture their Lives and endure Miſery, when they ſhall but thereby deprive themſelves of thoſe Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities (which others at Home ſhall ſeize) of which perchance they were certain, had they been preſent: And after this to be lookt upon but as Vagabonds at their return?</note> And that there
be ſome Regard had and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion

But eſpecially the Example of their B. <hi>Maſter, whoſe

finiſh his Work.</hi> And with the great St. <hi>Paul,</hi> let us be
evermore <hi>preſſed in Spirit, and ſtraightned in our Bowels,</hi>
at the thoughts of theſe Peoples deplorable Eſtate;
Not only the poor <hi>Barbarians,</hi> from whom the <hi>Key of
Knowledg is kept,</hi> and <hi>who are hindred from entering in,</hi>
but the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who are the <hi>Authors</hi> thereof. And
as <hi>Miltiades</hi> Victories did ſo inflame the emulous mind
of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> that he could not reſt for them; ſo
let the Memory of others more glorious <hi>Atchievements</hi>
in this kind, provoke in us the like pious Emulation,
not ſuffering us to <hi>give ſleep to our Eyes, nor ſlumber to
our Eyelids,</hi> until we have arrived within a proſpect of
its accompliſhment. Let us conſider, that we have no
more <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> for our ſilence than the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> with
other ſucceeding holy <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> had, who firſt
planted and watered the <hi>Church</hi> with their Blood; and
went about, and <hi>preached every where,</hi> when it was

death to be a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> That Faith is an active and
prolific Grace; and cannot remain in Idleneſs, but
muſt operate and imploy that Heavenly Heat which it
receives from above, for the uſe of others. That
there is no <hi>Neutrality</hi> in this War, and that whoever is
not actually in <hi>Arms</hi> prepared to fight <hi>againſt Sin</hi> and
<hi>Infidelity,</hi> is to be reputed a <hi>Conſpirator</hi> with them.
That there is the ſame Heaven and Salvation propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

<hi>Grandees;</hi> the whole being but the <hi>ſaving of Souls;</hi>
the effecting of which upon but a very few, is worth
the Labour of many, all their lives. Even <hi>we,</hi> no

<hi>to the Wiſe and to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwiſe.</hi> And God hath

Look upon them, and you cannot but ſee in their

that the firſt great Founders of our <hi>Faith</hi> were

Remembring that Difficulties are the common
pretences and <hi>Mormo's</hi> of inglorious Sloath, but ſpurs
and encouragements to a reſolved Diligence. Nor
ought any to be diſcouraged from <hi>letting down their
Nets,</hi> becauſe ſome perchance have already <hi>toiled to no
purpoſe:</hi> ſince by the Divine Benediction, attending
our patience and perſeverance, 'tis poſſible we may yet
obtain ſuch a lucky Draught, as that our Nets being
ready to break through the multitude of Fiſhes, we
may be forced to <hi>becken</hi> to our <hi>Friends and Partners</hi> on
the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Shore, to come in to our aſſiſtance. St. <hi>Bede
l. Hiſt. Eccl. Angl.</hi> relates, that in the Infancy of our
<hi>Church,</hi> ſuch a diſappointment happened in an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
part of our <hi>Nation;</hi> at which yet, he tells us
that others, nothing diſcouraged, in a ſecond attempt
perfected what the former had left for deſperate.
Even ſo we overlooking all Difficulties, and <hi>preſſing</hi>

that <hi>Prize</hi> for which we ſet forth, and accompliſh a
Work greatly tending to the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and to the

exhorteth, <hi>l. 6. de Sacerd. c.</hi> 40.) <hi>of Piety and a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Life faithfully complied with, we might ſoon, and
even without Miracles, convert the World!</hi> Wherefore,
<hi>Lift up the Hands that hang down, and the feeble Knees,</hi>
as ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> Let us be <hi>inſtant in ſeaſon and out
of ſeaſon,</hi> and <hi>keep back nothing of the whole Councel
of God,</hi> that is neceſſary for the Souls of Men. That
ſo when our Lord ſhall come to require his Sheep, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
unto us, as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> is ſaid to have done to <hi>Varus,</hi>
to reſtore the Souls committed to our Charge; <hi>We may
give our Account with Joy and not with Grief.</hi> And that
we now <hi>feeding the Flock of God, and taking the
overſight thereof (not by conſtraint but willingly; not for
filthy Lucre, but of a ready Mind) may, when the chief</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:56561:88"/>
Shepherd ſhall <hi>appear, receive a</hi> Crown <hi>of Glory, which
fadeth not away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And for the People, I ſhall propoſe unto them
three <hi>general Rules</hi> in this Affair to be guided
by. Whereof the firſt is, To make the <hi>Negro's</hi> caſe
our own, as being the beſt way, to judg what is fit for
others. And then to remember how unjuſt it would
ſeem to one of us, that our <hi>different White</hi> ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us of the leaſt Advantage; much more of the
greateſt, which <hi>Religion</hi> is. That <hi>Injunction</hi> of our
Bleſſed Lord, <hi>of dealing ſo with all Men,</hi> as we ſhould
upon the like change of our Fortunes expect from
them, being a Principle highly Moral, and Natural;
and ſufficient to make us wave thoſe proud diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which only avarice, and a too worthy conceit
of our ſelves, have taught us.</p>
               <p>3. And to this I ſhall, under the ſame Head, add
ſome few other Conſiderations of the ſame kind, which
may greatly add to our Security. As, 1. To reflect
how dangerous <hi>Extremities</hi> are, and that as <hi>nothing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
is laſting,</hi> ſo nothing is more <hi>permanent</hi> than <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
2. To think how inconvenient this Diſtance
and Difference between Man and Man, <hi>Indians</hi> and
<hi>Negro's, Engliſh</hi> and both, may in time prove. The <hi>Poets</hi>
advice,
<q xml:lang="lat">
                     <l>Tros Tyriúſ<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> mihi nullo diſcrimine agetur:</l>
                  </q>
being much more conducive to our Happineſs and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.
3. To meditate what fit <hi>Inſtruments</hi> for any
State <hi>Revolution,</hi> ſuch miſerable People are; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very <hi>numerous,</hi> ſhould not be too much <hi>Exaſperated,</hi>
nor driven into <hi>Deſperation.</hi> 4. To reflect what a
reproach and diſhonour to the <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> and
<hi>Government,</hi> our <hi>unchriſtian</hi> treating of theſe People
is. 5. Wiſely to look rather to the <hi>moſt laſting,</hi>
then to the <hi>preſent Gain;</hi> And in conſequence thereof,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56561:88"/>
                  <hi>Not to labour</hi> (ſo much) <hi>for the Meat that periſheth,</hi>
&amp;c. St. <hi>John</hi> 6. Laſtly, To remember <hi>at whoſe Hands
their Blood will be required,</hi> if they periſh; and not think
with <hi>Cain</hi> to ſhift the Guilt off, by demanding, <hi>Am I
my Slaves keeper,</hi> which certainly each of you are.
And therefore to be merciful to your <hi>own Souls,</hi> if not
to your <hi>Slaves. He that taketh warning ſhall deliver his
Soul,</hi> Ezek. 33. <hi>But otherwiſe his Blood ſhall be upon his
own Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Secondly, I ſhall beſeech you to look unto the
<hi>Generation of God's Children;</hi> and to ſee what is done
by others, whether at Home or Abroad, by our own
<hi>Countrymen,</hi> or by <hi>Strangers,</hi> both in <hi>Europe,</hi> and in
their remoter <hi>Colonies,</hi> and from thence to collect and
imitate the beſt Examples. As for our own <hi>Nation,</hi> if
we look into <hi>New-England,</hi> they ſcruple not to admit
either <hi>Negro's</hi> or <hi>Indians,</hi> when capacitated and fit for
it, to their very <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which very many of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> cannot obtain. The Infants alſo of ſuch are
allowed <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> And of the <hi>Bermudians</hi> I have <hi>(Page</hi>
143) before ſpoken.</p>
               <p>5. Again, if we appeal to our Mother-Country, the
reſpect there to them is <hi>notorious,</hi> and even become the
Scoff of this place. 'Tis true, their <hi>Zeal</hi> is ſaid of
late to be much abated. But this, as 'tis the Crime of
ſome few, whoſe great <hi>Wiſdom</hi> conſiſteth only in <hi>get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Money (the grand Antichriſt</hi> of our <hi>Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which, in the very letter of the Text, they exalt,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>above God
and Religion:)</hi> So I doubt not but their <hi>Impiety</hi> will
in time be better lookt into, and a ſtop be put to its
further growth, at leaſt there: And thoſe <hi>Mammoniſts</hi>
be obliged to a more Chriſtian deportment and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with the univerſal practice of all Believers,
eſpecially of our <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> till now.</p>
               <p>6. And as to <hi>Foraign Nations</hi> 'tis certain, that they
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56561:89"/>
treat their <hi>Negro's</hi> and others, both <hi>here</hi> and in <hi>Europe,</hi>
as Men capacitated <hi>for the like hopes</hi> with themſelves.
And in conſequence of that belief, do not only
permit, but compel them to partake with themſelves
in <hi>Religion.</hi> Of whom ſome are daily promoted to
the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and other Offices in the <hi>Church.</hi> And I
have here ſeen and diſcourſed with divers, who were
brought from thoſe parts; which, beſides ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of that nature which I had otherwiſe met with,
hath aſcertained me of the truth thereof. Now all
theſe, were they not better principled, might urge the
like Objections againſt their being made <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
which our ſelves do here. But they are not yet arrived
to that <hi>wiſdom</hi> and fore-ſight as to apprehend the
<hi>Dangers and Inconveniencies</hi> of Religion.</p>
               <p>7. Thirdly, I ſhall recommend unto them, 1. A
frequent view of the <hi>Terms,</hi> by which only they can
pretend a Right to God's Temporal <hi>Bleſſings. He gave
them the Lands of the Heathen,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, that they
might obſerve his Statutes, and keep his Laws.</hi> So that
<hi>obedience to God's Laws</hi> can only entitle Men to the
<hi>good things</hi> that they here enjoy: Which if referred to
Chriſtianity, doth, no queſtion, amongſt other, infer
this <hi>Duty</hi> alſo. 2. And then after a ſerious view of
the <hi>Terms,</hi> to ſee how others have fared upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews, Rom.</hi> 9. hath theſe
words, <hi>Becauſe of unbelief they were broken off, and thou
ſtandeſt by Faith.</hi> And in the <hi>Acts,</hi> he beſpeaks the
ſame <hi>Jews</hi> to have <hi>thruſt from them the Word of Eternal
Life.</hi> And in another place not only ſo, but they are
alſo charged with <hi>forbidding the Preaching of it to the</hi>
Gentiles, <hi>that they might be ſaved:</hi> The crying Sin of
theſe <hi>Colonies!</hi> From which impudent deſpite done to
<hi>Religion,</hi> he ominates their ſpeedy deſtruction, and
that <hi>Wrath which ſhould</hi> (and not long after did) <hi>come
upon them</hi> even to their <hi>utter Extermination,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2. 16.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56561:89"/>
And, <hi>3ly.</hi> After all, to apply this unto our ſelves, <hi>If
God ſpared not the Natural Branches, how much leſs will
he ſpare thee? Be not therefore high-minded, but fear;
for otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be broken off.</hi> Nor is this the
<hi>utmoſt</hi> of the danger; but there is mentioned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
further, 2 Theſſ. 1. <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
from Heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming
Fire, taking vengeance of them that know not God, and that
obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who ſhall be
puniſht with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the
Lord, and from the glory of his Power; when he ſhall
come to be admired in his Saints, and to be glorified in all
them that believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. But if none of all theſe <hi>Conſiderations</hi> will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
the laſt thing I ſhall propoſe, is, That you will
now at length remove that <hi>Vizard,</hi> and undeceive the
World, who have been apt hitherto, becauſe <hi>going by
that Name,</hi> to believe you <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> Which Name
with what face Men can thus uſurp, whoſe
practices do prove them not ſo much as <hi>tollerable
Heathens,</hi> is in truth my great wonder and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment;
and whilſt they retain, <hi>Iſtam in figurâ homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
feritatem &amp; immanitatem belluae;</hi> Such a brutiſh <hi>ferity</hi>
under humane appearance. Since the <hi>Orator</hi> (as
before <hi>P.</hi> 87, 88.) informs us, <hi>That it is more againſt
Nature, for one Man to wrong another, for his private
Gain, than Death, Poverty, Pain, or any other Calamity.
That they who do hold the contrary, do ſeparate Man from
himſelf. That he is miſtaken that thinks any diſcommodity
either of Body or Eſtate, to be ſorer than the Vices of the
Mind. That no Man's Life can be more profitable, than ſuch
a diſpoſition of mind, not to violate any, even the moſt deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Wretch, for his Profits ſake.</hi> Which being true,
where will your pretended <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> be found, who
againſt all Conſcience and Reaſon, are ſo unjuſt and
cruel to your Slaves? Wherefore till you can afford to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56561:90"/>
comport your ſelves more agreeable thereto, be but ſo
juſt to your ſelves and us, as to decline the <hi>Name:</hi>
That ſo your <hi>Inhumanity, Avarice,</hi> and <hi>Irreligion,</hi>
may no longer be a Stain and Reproach to that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;</hi>
unto which otherwiſe the Generality will be
apt to aſcribe them. Nor let any one think ſtrange of
this Propoſal, which is but Juſt and Reaſonable: It
being a moſt undoubted <hi>Truth,</hi> and for which, I
think, I ſhould not be afraid to become a Martyr, <hi>That
they who do induſtriouſly oppoſe the propagation of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
eſpecially <hi>in their own Families, can be themſelves</hi>
(at moſt) <hi>but Heathens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. Nor let any here go about to take <hi>Sanctuary</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Tenet, <hi>That God accepts not the Services
of Slaves.</hi> This, like the reſt, being but a <hi>poor ſhift,</hi>
and will hardly ſtand them in ſtead, when the <hi>ruſt of
their ill-gotten Treaſure,</hi> for <hi>which they have ſinned againſt
their own Souls, ſhall be a witneſs againſt them;</hi> it being
certain, that whatever is perfect in its kind, is equally
grateful to an impartial Goodneſs. And ſhould any
<hi>Act</hi> of theirs prove leſs perfect, yet where out of their
power to remedy, it cannot be leſs <hi>accepted</hi> by Him,
who requires no more than he gives, and judges by
the intent, and reſpects <hi>not how great,</hi> but <hi>how good</hi>
our Offerings are; and hath moreover by his Apoſtle,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. declared, <hi>That if there be firſt a willing Mind,
it is accepted according to what a Man hath, not according
to what he hath not.</hi> No act of the Soul being to be
reputed faulty, for the infirmities of the Body, any
more than a <hi>Priſoner</hi> can be accountable for his <hi>Keepers</hi>
cruelty, or a <hi>Slave</hi> for his <hi>Maſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. Let not then the <hi>Negro</hi> too much deſpond, or
ſink under theſe Diſcouragements; but rather aſſure
himſelf, That ſince <hi>God cannot but have a deſire to the
work of his Hands;</hi> nothing but his own neglect can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his Happineſs: And that ſince He ſent <hi>his Son</hi> to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56561:90"/>
                  <hi>Redeem all,</hi> there is Mercy in ſtore for him alſo. <hi>For</hi>
(to apply the words of the <hi>Evangelical Prophet</hi> to this
caſe) <hi>the Son of the Stranger, that hath joyned himſelf
to the</hi> Lord, <hi>is not to ſpeak, ſaying, The</hi> Lord <hi>hath ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ſeparated me from his People; neither let the</hi> Eunuch
<hi>ſay,</hi> I am a dead Tree. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord, even
unto them that chuſe the things that pleaſe me, and that
take hold of my</hi> Covenant, <hi>will I give in mine Houſe, and
within my Walls, a Place and a</hi> Name, <hi>better than of
Sons and Daughters, and I will give them an everlaſting</hi>
Name, <hi>that ſhall not be cut off. Alſo the</hi> Sons <hi>of the</hi>
Stranger <hi>that joyn themſelves to the</hi> Lord <hi>to ſerve him, and
to love the</hi> Name <hi>of the</hi> Lord, <hi>and to be his</hi> Servants;
<hi>even them will I bring to my holy Mountain, and make
them joyful</hi> in my Houſe of Prayer: <hi>Their</hi> Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<hi>and their</hi> Sacrifices <hi>ſhall be accepted upon mine</hi> Altar;
<hi>for mine Houſe ſhall be called an Houſe of Prayer for all
People,</hi> Iſa. 56. Now theſe <hi>Evangelical</hi> Promiſes of
Admittance and Acceptance being ſo general, and
without any reſpect of Perſons, it cannot be doubted
but theſe are comprehended in them. Wherefore, to
determine all in the words of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Gal. 3. 26,
28, 29. &amp; 4. 7. <hi>If thou,</hi> O black <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> art
become <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciple and Servant, and doſt <hi>by
Faith</hi> truly embrace and lay hold of him, <hi>then art thou,</hi>
as to thy Soul, and all the ends and purpoſes of the

(expoſed to public
view more of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> and
to vindicate my ſelf, than of <hi>choice)</hi> is
becauſe it may no leſs need your <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage,</hi>
than the <hi>Author</hi> himſelf did, during his abode
in that your <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Virginia.</hi> A <hi>Colony</hi> that may
be ſaid wholly to owe it ſelf to your <hi>Excellency,</hi> made
happy by your Prudent Government, as being the
Prime, if not the only <hi>Raiſer</hi> of her to her preſent
Greatneſs; having firſt reſcued her from moſt imminent
and apparent Deſtruction; whilſt by your noble and
wiſe Conduct, you not only broke the force of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemy,</hi> but ſo utterly ſubdued, as to extinguiſh
in them all hopes, and to deſtroy the very Seeds of any
future Diſturbance, which might ariſe through their
Occaſion.</p>
            <p>And having like a tender <hi>Father</hi> nouriſhed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that <hi>Colony</hi> in her <hi>Infancy</hi> and <hi>Non-age,</hi> you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
guarded her ever ſince, having ſcarce ſet Foot off
that Soil for well near theſe forty Years. Under whoſe

Country. So that we may without <hi>Aſſentation</hi>
affirm, that your Excellency hath been no leſs a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
to <hi>Virginia</hi> in her diſtreſs, than <hi>Virginia</hi> hath
been unto others. Which tho ſhe hath happily ſince
outgrown, yet your <hi>Excellency</hi> doth not ceaſe ſtill to
make evident proof of your Innate Affection to her,
yearly expending your proper Income and Revenue for
the good of her; paying her much more Credit and
Support than you receive; thereby demonſtrating that
the only reward you deſire and wiſh, is that ſhe may
thrive and proſper.</p>
            <p>But as our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> once ſaid to the young Man
in the <hi>Goſpel, Yet lackeſt thou one thing to be perfect;</hi> ſo may
we, and I fear too truly, ſay of <hi>Virginia,</hi> that there is one
thing, the Propagation and Eſtabliſhing of <hi>Relig<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>n</hi> in
her, wanting; which if by your <hi>Excellencies Piety</hi> added,
would make your <hi>Name</hi> great, and your <hi>Memory</hi> glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
no leſs than that place, which hath ſo long been
the Seat of your Government, <hi>Happy.</hi> For there is no pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Eye nor Heart can conſider the great (Neglect ſhall
I ſay? or rather) contempt of <hi>Religion</hi> there, without
<hi>reſolving</hi> it ſelf <hi>into Sighs and Tears.</hi> It is moſt certain
that there are many <hi>Families,</hi> who have never been
preſent at any public Exerciſe of <hi>Religion</hi> ſince their
<hi>Importation</hi> into that <hi>Colony.</hi> The <hi>Miniſters</hi> alſo are moſt
miſerably handled by their <hi>Plebeian Junto's,</hi> the <hi>Veſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
To whom the <hi>Hiring</hi> (that is the uſual word
there) and Admiſſion of <hi>Miniſters</hi> is ſolely left. And
there being no Law obliging them to any more than
to procure a <hi>Lay-Reader</hi> (to be obtained at a very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
rate): They either reſolve to have <hi>none at all,</hi>
or reduce them to their own <hi>Terms;</hi> that is, to <hi>uſe
them how they pleaſe,</hi> pay them <hi>what they liſt,</hi> and to
<hi>diſcard</hi> them <hi>whenſoever they have a mind to it.</hi> And
this is the recompence of their leaving their hopes in
<hi>England</hi> (far more conſiderable to the meaneſt Curate,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56561:92"/>
than whatever can poſſibly be apprehended there)
together with their <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> and their
<hi>Native Soil,</hi> to venture their Lives into thoſe parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Strangers and Enemies to their Profeſſion, who
look upon them as a Burden; as being with their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi>
(where they have any) to be ſupported out of
their Labour. So that I dare boldly aver, that our
Diſcouragements there are much greater, than ever
they were here in <hi>England,</hi> under the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers.</hi> I
ſhall, to avoid tediouſneſs and multiplicity of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
Inſtance only in their being <hi>hired from Year to Year,</hi>
and made to accept of Pariſhes at under Rates, which
I think was never practiſed in thoſe Times, eſpecially
upon ſuch as were approved by <hi>their own Laws</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to <hi>their Government,</hi> which thoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> now
in <hi>Virginia</hi> in all things are to the <hi>Government</hi> there.</p>
            <p>Sir, I would not be thought to ſpeak this out of
any deſign to diſparage the Place; It being a Country
ſo <hi>Fruitful,</hi> and withal ſo <hi>Pleaſant,</hi> eſpecially towards
the Southern parts, as <hi>Carolina,</hi> &amp;c. that I do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it before <hi>England</hi> in many things; but may juſtly
equal it thereto in all; Thoſe only excepted, which
Time and multitudes of People muſt produce. Only
I cannot but think it great pity, that a <hi>Region</hi> ſo richly
furniſhed with <hi>Bleſſings of the Left,</hi> ſhould ſo much
want thoſe more neceſſary ones <hi>of the Right-Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much leſs would I herein be thought to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your <hi>Excellency,</hi> who have always profeſſed a great
tenderneſs for <hi>Church-Men.</hi> For alas, theſe things are
kept from your Ears; nor dare the Miniſters, had they
opportunity, acquaint you with them, for fear of being
uſed worſe. And there being no <hi>Superiour</hi> Clergyman,
neither in <hi>Council</hi> nor in any place of Authority, for
them to addreſs their Complaints to, and by his means
have their Grievances brought to your <hi>Excellencie's</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:56561:93"/>
knowledg, they are left without Remedy. Beſides,
their <hi>Adverſaries</hi> have that uſual craft of underhand
blaſting their Fame, and charging them with <hi>Litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi>
(which is nothing elſe but <hi>a ſuing for their
own,)</hi> or prepoſſeſſing your <hi>Excellency</hi> with forged
Stories, either by themſelves invented, or known to
be as Falſe, as the beſt Evidence can make them. But
yet when thereby a <hi>ſecret Prejudice</hi> is conceived
againſt them, and the cauſe unknown, they find it
impoſſible to redeem their Reputations with your <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</hi>
But,
<q xml:lang="lat">Dat veniam Corvis, vexat cenſura Columbas:</q>
For where any thing is truly Chargeable, as is frequent
amongſt their <hi>leaden Lay-Prieſts</hi>
of the <hi>Veſteries ordination</hi>
(<note n="*" place="margin">How true this is, may be gathered from the <hi>Story</hi> of a certain <hi>Writing-Maſter</hi> who came into <hi>Virginia,</hi> firſt as <hi>Biſhop</hi> thereof; but that not taking, he profeſſed himſelf <hi>Doctor</hi> of Divinity, and wore a Scarlet Hood in the Pulpit, going by the name of <hi>Dr. Dacres,</hi> and ſhewing <hi>Orders</hi> under that <hi>Name.</hi> But, being diſcovered, hath ſince changed that <hi>Name</hi> to <hi>Acworth;</hi> yet to this hour continues his Preaching and Doctorſhip, if alive, which lately he was.</note> which make up near two
thirds of the Preachers), and
is both the ſhame and grief of
the rightly Ordained Clergie
there; Nothing of this ever
reaches your <hi>Excellencie's</hi>
Ear: Thoſe hungry <hi>Patrons</hi>
knowing better how to make
benefit by <hi>their Vices,</hi> than
by the <hi>Vertues</hi> of the other.</p>
            <p>The Laws alſo which are tranſmitted hither to invite
the Subjects into thoſe Parts, are many of them ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
and obſcure, (not to ſay contradictory and <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious)
that they ſeem rather to be <hi>Traps and Pit-fals,</hi>
than Laws: I ſhall inſtance in two. The firſt is,
That wherein Servitude for four Years is made the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56561:93"/>
penalty of accepting of anothers Kindneſs (if I may
ſo term it); that is, for permitting ones ſelf to be
Tranſported <hi>gratis,</hi> when with much ſeeming Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie
and Importunity offered unto them: For thereby
the Party (whether Miniſter or other, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception)
doth, by virtue of that Law, put himſelf
into the Tranſporters power, and is made to become
his Servant, or to Ranſome himſelf from that Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Miſery at a very great rate, perhaps four or
five times ſo much as their Paſſage ſhould have coſt
them. A deceit which no <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> not verſed in
thoſe <hi>American Arts</hi> and <hi>Frauds,</hi> can provide againſt;
and is indeed the great ſtay and ſupport of the <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nappers</hi>
Trade and Myſtery. A Trade that, 'tis thought,
carries off and conſumes not ſo little as ten thouſand
People out of this Kingdom yearly; which might have
been a defence to their Mother-Country, but now are
many of them miſerably deſtroyed, without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is that Act, wherein, (contradictory
to it ſelf, no leſs than to our Act of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> and
to another of their own), it is declared, <hi>That to the
intent that Servants Marriages may not be made in ſecret,
they are forbidden to be publiſhed</hi> (before hand by <hi>Banns,</hi>
the uſual and only way of preventing that Secreſie,
and that under no leſs penalty than 10000 pounds
of <hi>Tabacco;</hi> a Sum almoſt (if not quite) double to
divers <hi>Miniſters</hi> Incom and Allowance. And this for
a thing unto which they are bound under as great Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
by the ſaid <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> and other Laws
enjoyning the ſaid Publications. Which being once
by moſt of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of that <hi>Colony,</hi> in an humble
Addreſs and Petition to your <hi>Excellency</hi> repreſented, as
both unreaſonable and unpoſſible to be complied
with, (at the ſame time giving in their reaſons for
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56561:94"/>
that <hi>Allegation);</hi> they were ſo far from finding
Redreſs from the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> then ſitting, unto whom it
was referred, that the <hi>Miniſters</hi> found their condition
much more uneaſie afterward, than it was before. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the preſent Puniſhing of the Promoters thereof,
tho not under that, but another Guiſe. I might here
alſo inſert the danger which doth uſually enſue to the
<hi>Miniſter</hi> upon his demanding the benefit of thoſe Laws
which concern their Maintenance: This being a
Crime, which no <hi>Grandee</hi> of any <hi>Veſtry,</hi> throughout
the Country, ſhall ever forgive.</p>
            <p>To this may be added the profound Silence as to
things given to Pious Uſes; the not only permitting
but commiſſioning <hi>Lay-Men</hi> to preach, and to enjoy
four or five Pariſhes (but at under Rates): <hi>Deacons</hi>
to undermine and thruſt out <hi>Presbyters,</hi> to Adminiſter
the Sacraments, reade the Abſolution, and enjoy Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities.
Their ſuffering Pariſhes to extend to ſixty
or ſeventy Miles in length, or letting them lie void
for many Years together to ſave Charges, (as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis,
your Honour's Pariſh, did (as 'tis ſaid) for
near twenty Years, ſome little Intervals only excepted):
And in a word, the permitting of all things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> to the Mercy of the
People.</p>
            <p>One thing I had almoſt forgotten, and that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the eſtabliſhing of <hi>Religion</hi> amongſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
the <hi>propagating</hi> of it amongſt the <hi>Heathen,</hi> both <hi>Natives</hi>
and <hi>Slaves</hi> alſo brought from other parts. Which
tho, as muſt be piouſly ſuppoſed, it were the only
end of God's diſcovering thoſe Countries to us,
yet is there lookt upon, by our new Race of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
as ſo idle and Ridiculous, ſo utterly needleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary,
that no Man can forfeit his Judgment more,
than by any propoſal looking or tending that way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:56561:94"/>
I preſume I need not acquaint your Excellencie
how uſeful <hi>Religion,</hi> where it hath not loſt its Force,
(and there it ought by all means to be revived) is
to the eaſe and ſupport of <hi>Government,</hi> and may prove,
to the ſecuring of the <hi>King</hi>'s Intereſt in thoſe <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
Nor what an excellent <hi>Heathen</hi> Writer tells us,
<hi>That Religion is the Cement of all Communities, and the
chief</hi> Baſis <hi>of Legiſlative Power: That it is much more
eaſie to build a</hi> Caſtle (we may alſo add, To plant a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony)
<hi>in the open Air, without any ground to found it
upon, than to eſtabliſh a Government without</hi> Religion.
Much leſs that the deſpiſing of the <hi>Ephod,</hi> was the
Rot of <hi>Sauls</hi> Kingdom and Government: And that
the cauſe why <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is made to carry that infamous
Train and Brand, Jeroboam <hi>the Son of</hi> Nebat, <hi>who
made</hi> Iſrael <hi>to ſin,</hi> nineteen times after him in ſacred
Scripture, was only for the contempt of <hi>Religion,</hi> and
his committing the ſacred Oracles to unclean and
unholy Hands. Your <hi>Excellency</hi> knows all theſe things
already, and needs no information; who doubtleſs
are poſſeſſed with a deep inward veneration and ſenſe
of <hi>Religion</hi> upon a much higher <hi>Account,</hi> and that is
<hi>the ſalvation of Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, let me be bold to be your Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer,
and to mind your <hi>Excellency</hi> how needful it
is, that thoſe good Laws which are made for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of <hi>Vice,</hi> and for <hi>reducing</hi> the People from this
affected <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> to a more diligent and conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
diſcharge of their Duty to <hi>God,</hi> (the <hi>only ſure
means to retain them in their due Allegiance to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign)</hi>
be by the Inferiour Magiſtrates more duly
executed; The <hi>Miniſters</hi> encouraged, and all Invaders
